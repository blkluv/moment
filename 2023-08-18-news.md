### Transcript

Hello and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is August 18th, 2023. Let's get started with today's news stories.

First up, we have a landmark win for transparency as activists celebrate a court order for Covid vaccine contracts to be made public. A South African court has ruled that the National Department of Health must release the Covid-19 vaccine procurement contracts and related documents within 10 days. This decision is seen as a significant victory for transparency and accountability, as it emphasizes the importance of public scrutiny over vaccine agreements. The ruling may set a precedent for other countries as well. However, the government may still appeal the order. This ruling has broad implications for healthcare procurement transparency, potentially influencing other jurisdictions. 

Moving on to Swellendam, a town in South Africa, which is currently on a knife-edge after violent protests. The town has experienced violent demonstrations due to steep municipal tariff increases. The main municipal building was destroyed, resulting in a cost of about R25 million to rebuild. Residents are expressing their anger over exorbitant increases in electricity, refuse collection, and water tariffs. The situation has led to chaos and the blocking of the N2 highway. The mayor is concerned about the loss of funds that could have been used for community services. The police have made several arrests, and law enforcement continues to monitor the situation.

Next, we have the untold story of how Australia won the hosting rights to the Women's World Cup. Steven Lowy's role in Australia and New Zealand's successful bid for hosting the tournament has been highlighted. Despite past challenges and corruption allegations surrounding FIFA, Lowy successfully convinced then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to support the bid. The joint bid with New Zealand reflects the collective efforts of many individuals and key changes within FIFA. Australia's hosting of the Women's World Cup has had remarkable achievements, including packed stadiums, record TV ratings, and a significant impact on women's football and sport in the country.

In rugby news, World Rugby has officially appealed the disciplinary decision regarding Owen Farrell's controversial tackle during England's victory over Wales. Initially receiving a yellow card, the tackle was upgraded to a red card following a review. However, an all-Australian judicial committee cleared Farrell, ruling that the tackle deserved only a yellow card. World Rugby is appealing this decision, emphasizing the importance of player welfare and the head contact process at the elite level. An independent appeal committee will be appointed to determine the matter.

Lastly, let's talk about some new movies and TV shows to stream this week. We have "Heart of Stone," an action film on Netflix starring Gal Gadot, which has been compared to "Mission Impossible." There's also "Painkiller," a six-episode Netflix series featuring Matthew Broderick as a big pharma boss related to the opioid crisis in America. Another option is "Moving," a unique Korean drama series on Disney Plus that revolves around teenagers in Seoul inheriting secret powers. And finally, "Only Murders in the Building Season 3" returns on Disney Plus, featuring a star-studded cast including Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez, Paul Rudd, and Meryl Streep. These selections offer a variety of genres and themes to cater to different viewer preferences.

That's all for today's news stories. Thank you for joining us on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
