Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is August 20th, 2023. Let's jump right into today's headlines.

In the world of sports, Siya Kolisi made a triumphant return to the Springbok team as they defeated Wales 52-16 in a dominant display. Kolisi's fearless performance, after nearly five months of absence, contributed significantly to South Africa's victory. The Springboks showcased their multifaceted attacking play, scoring eight tries and demonstrating their readiness for the Rugby World Cup title defense. It was a tough day for Wales, who were outclassed by the powerful and enterprising Springboks.

Moving on to the UFC, Sean O'Malley claimed the bantamweight title with a second-round knockout over Aljamain Sterling in UFC 292. O'Malley's elite striking ability was on full display as he delivered a vicious right-hand counter punch that led to Sterling's faceplant and the subsequent stoppage of the fight. Sterling graciously congratulated O'Malley and acknowledged the need to reassess his future plans. With this victory, O'Malley solidifies his status as a marquee UFC star and sets his sights on seeking revenge against 'Chito' Vera in his next fight.

In soccer news, Lionel Messi led Inter Miami to victory over Nashville SC in the Leagues Cup final. Messi scored in the 23rd minute, marking his 10th goal in seven games since joining Inter Miami. Although Nashville equalized in the 56th minute, the match ended in a draw, leading to a thrilling penalty shootout that went to the 11th round. Inter Miami's goalkeeper, Drake Callender, played a crucial role in both scoring his penalty and making the decisive save. The victory marked Inter Miami's first trophy, and the team and fans celebrated with great enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Nashville coach Gary Smith acknowledged Messi's significant impact on the game.

Now, let's shift gears to a more mysterious topic. A video from 2015 showing what appears to be Bigfoot in the Mississippi woods has gained attention, accumulating over 811,000 views on YouTube. The video, recorded by Josh Highcliffe while hunting, depicts a creature that he describes as seven feet tall and unlike a bear. Many viewers have praised it as the most convincing footage of Bigfoot they've seen. Despite no concrete evidence, rumors of Bigfoot's existence have persisted for centuries in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. This video adds to the numerous unconfirmed sightings, including 676 in Washington and 445 in California, according to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization.

Lastly, we have a heartwarming story of kindness and remembrance. In South Africa's Sun City, the Valley of the Waves has become a site for a touching memorial dedicated to Josh Edwards, a young man known for his kindness and love. After his tragic death in 2021, the community rallied around the Edwards family, supporting them during the trial and launching the "Justice4Josh" campaign.

Sun City, a place filled with cherished memories for the Edwards family, went above and beyond to honor Josh's memory. They provided the family with the Presidential Suite and organized a special memorial event on an island in the Valley of the Waves. A plaque, accompanied by a collage of Josh's memories and his favorite songs, was unveiled, creating a beautiful tribute. Despite not knowing all the details surrounding Josh's death, the Sun City team demonstrated immense compassion and empathy.

This story reminds us of the profound impact of kindness and how a community can come together to heal wounded hearts, even in the darkest times.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
