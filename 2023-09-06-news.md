Hello and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and here are today's headlines for September 6, 2023.

In a historic U.S. Open quarterfinal, Ben Shelton defeated Frances Tiafoe in a stunning upset. This match marked the first time two Black men reached this tournament stage. Shelton's win makes him the youngest American male in the Open semifinals since 1992. He will now face World No. 2 Novak Djokovic in the next round.

Manchester United's share price has tumbled by over R13 billion as the club's sale is in question. The club's two leading suitors, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe and Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani, have both submitted deals valuing United at approximately five billion pounds. The Glazers, who hold about two-thirds of the club's capital, still have almost all voting rights.

Mozambique is frustrated with Eskom's lack of progress on a 100MW power deal. Three months ago, South Africa and Mozambique signed an agreement for Mozambique to supply electricity to help alleviate South Africa's Stage 6 load shedding crisis. However, there has been no movement on the deal. Mozambique is now pushing for ministerial-level intervention.

Shoprite, Africa's largest supermarket chain, has reported a sales boom of R215 billion. The company saw a 16.9% increase in merchandise sales, attributed to strategic shifts and aggressive store openings. Checkers, one of Shoprite's sub-brands, experienced significant growth, with an 18% increase in merchandise sales. However, the company also faced margin pressures due to lower selling prices and increased expenses.

The Springbok rugby team is utilizing technology as their secret weapon in the Rugby World Cup. They employ a robust technological ecosystem that includes GPS pods, heart-rate belts, and data-capturing devices to measure performance and make data-driven decisions. This data is then analyzed using software and athlete management systems. The team's data-driven approach is implemented at all levels, allowing for effective allocation of resources.

Spotify's $1 billion podcast bet has turned into a serial drama. Despite investing heavily in podcasting with big deals, Spotify's podcasting endeavor has been largely unprofitable. This has led to staff layoffs and reduced programming. Competitors like Apple, Amazon, and Google are in a more financially stable position due to their diversified businesses. Spotify is under pressure to meet profitability goals and has begun sharing investment risks with talent like Trevor Noah. The company's podcast business model is being questioned for its sustainability.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. I'm Erika, and this is Just a Moment News.
