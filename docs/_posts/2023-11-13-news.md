Welcome to Just a Moment News, I'm Erika. Today, we have a variety of news stories to discuss. Let's start with the world of golf. Max Homa, ranked world No. 8 in golf, secured a historic win at the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa. This victory makes him the first American champion since Jim Furyk in 2006. Homa's impressive performance throughout the tournament, including a crucial eagle on the ninth hole, helped him maintain his lead and finish at 19-under-par 269. He expressed his gratitude for the support he received in South Africa and mentioned the special experience of playing there. Additionally, the article highlights a charity initiative called MavericKids, which aims to address literacy issues among South African children by donating books to those in need.

Moving on to technology news, Openserve has recently launched a unique fibre-to-the-room (FTTR) package in South Africa. This package offers 1Gbps speeds and includes a comprehensive setup with multiple Wi-Fi access points and optic cables throughout the home. However, it is currently only available through one ISP, Telsense, at a price of approximately R2,900 per month for a 24-month contract. This offering fills a market gap for high-end broadband with premium Wi-Fi solutions, but it is priced higher than rival packages. Users who require gigabit speeds in specific areas or on select devices may find simpler network expansions using Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi extenders to be a more cost-effective solution.

In the world of entertainment, Warner Bros. has reversed its decision regarding the film "Coyote vs. Acme." Initially, the studio had planned to shelve the $70 million Looney Tunes film indefinitely, without the ability to place it elsewhere. However, after receiving backlash from filmmakers and the animation community, Warner Bros. executives have now allowed the filmmakers to shop the movie to other potential distributors. The film, directed by Dave Green and starring John Cena, Will Forte, and a CGI Wile E. Coyote, will have the opportunity to be released by another studio.

Next, we turn to Nigeria, where banking tycoon Herbert Wigwe is investing in a new university named Wigwe University. With a projected cost of $500 million, this university aims to address the skills gap in finance and technology in Nigeria. It will offer undergraduate courses in various fields, including management, science and engineering, IT, and creative arts. Wigwe plans to hire 30% of the faculty from the UK and US, and the university expects to enroll 1,400 students initially, with potential growth to 10,000 students in five years. The initiative aims to provide a quality education that matches the standards of the US and UK, cultivating future leaders in banking and beyond.

In the world of film, "Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie" was the big winner at the 2023 Critics Choice Documentary Awards. The film claimed five awards, including best biographical documentary, best direction, best editing, and best narration by Michael J. Fox himself. The event recognized achievements across 18 categories in documentary films, TV, and digital platforms. Other notable winners included "American Symphony" for best music documentary and best score, as well as "20 Days in Mariupol" for best first documentary feature and best political documentary. The ceremony celebrated the diverse range of documentary films and highlighted exceptional filmmaking talent.

Lastly, we have a mysterious real estate story from South Africa. Casablanca, the country's most expensive house, is currently on the market for R700 million. Located in Camps Bay, Cape Town, this luxurious property features eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, and various amenities such as a gym, sauna, and Olympic-size pool. Despite the property attracting local and international interest, the owner's identity remains unknown. Efforts to uncover the owner through property experts and community members have been unsuccessful, with authorities and ratepayer associations citing privacy and safety concerns. If sold, Casablanca is expected to set a record in the South African housing market.

That wraps up today's news stories. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
