### Transcript

Good day, listeners! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for today, November 10, 2023. Let's dive right in.

First up, we have a story about a startup called Humane, based in San Francisco. They recently unveiled their new AI Pin product, which aims to go beyond the capabilities of smartphones. The AI Pin features advanced technology, including a Snapdragon processor, 32GB storage, and a 12-megapixel camera. It also integrates various large language models and has partnerships with companies like OpenAI and Microsoft. However, the demand and practicality of the device remain uncertain. Despite a waiting list of over 110,000 people, it's unclear how many will actually make a purchase. The device faces challenges in pricing, form factor, and limited health tracking capabilities.

Next, we have a success story from South Africa's largest grocery retailer, Shoprite Group. They attribute their operational efficiencies and business success to the implementation of SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. This integrated system provides a comprehensive view of the business and supports various functions, from supply chain management to online operations. Shoprite's average annual sales growth of 7.4% and profit growth of 4.1% reflect the positive impact of this software. They have also highlighted its role in supporting their on-demand delivery service, Checkers Sixty60.

Moving on, we have news about Trevor Noah, the former host of The Daily Show. He has launched a new podcast on Spotify called "What Now?". In his first episode, he interviewed Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, discussing various topics. Noah aims to show that celebrities can engage in meaningful discussions through podcasts, a trend that has been observed with other celebrities like Conan O'Brien and Stephen Colbert. However, some question the uniqueness of these shows when similar content is available across multiple platforms.

In the business world, DStv owner MultiChoice has warned shareholders of a significant rise in its interim loss. This is due to the effects of weaker African currencies and costs related to their new streaming service, Showmax. MultiChoice has been looking to expand its reach across Africa and has partnered with US media giant Comcast. While trading profit is expected to be lower, management is focused on pricing, cost disciplines, and subscriber retention to deliver encouraging results.

In the world of music, Tracy Chapman's hit song "Fast Car" has won the Country Music Award for Song of the Year. This is a remarkable achievement considering the song debuted 35 years ago. Its resurgence in popularity came after country star Luke Combs released a cover of the hit single, which reached No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart. Chapman became the first Black woman to top the chart since its inception in 1990. Both Chapman and Combs were recognized at the CMAs.

Lastly, we have an interesting discovery related to Led Zeppelin's iconic album cover for "Led Zeppelin IV." A researcher named Brian Edwards identified a 19th-century thatcher named Lot Long in the photo. The original black and white photograph was found in an album titled "Reminiscences of a visit to Shaftesbury. Whitsuntide 1892." This discovery sheds new light on the album cover and adds to the historical context of rural and urban life.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
