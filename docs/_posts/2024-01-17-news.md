### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News'. Today is January 17, 2024, and I have a handful of interesting news stories to share with you. Let's dive right in.

First up, South Africa is seeing some impressive strides in internet speed. Paul Butschi, co-owner of Cool Ideas, is currently testing a 10Gbps fibre-to-the-home connection, a speed that's ten times faster than the standard available in the country. This is part of a potential commercial launch for a 10Gbps product. However, it's interesting to note that Vumatel, the company that installed the line, has been more focused on entry-level services in less affluent areas, indicating a possible shift in market strategy. The high-speed connection required specialized hardware, and though the speed tests showed impressive results, they were limited by server capabilities.

Next, we have Brittany Pietsch, a former Cloudflare employee, who has gone viral after posting a video of her firing on TikTok. Pietsch questioned representatives about her dismissal and the absence of her manager during the call. The incident has sparked debates online about the challenges companies face in conducting layoffs, especially in remote or hybrid work environments. While Cloudflare's CEO admitted the dismissal process was flawed, Pietsch remains optimistic about her career prospects.

In Johannesburg, Fourways Mall is facing a significant crisis with over a quarter of its roughly 450 stores remaining vacant since its reopening in August 2019. The mall's owners, Accelerate Property Fund, have appointed new managing agents and plan to invest R200 million in repositioning the mall with a focus on family-oriented aspects. However, the mall's layout and competition from nearby malls present additional challenges.

South African UFC star Dricus du Plessis is set to fight Sean Strickland for the middleweight title at UFC 297 in Toronto. Du Plessis, undefeated in the UFC since October 2020, has gained widespread support from notable figures like Springbok captain Siya Kolisi and fullback Willie le Roux.

Moving on, Durban and surrounding areas, particularly Umhlanga, are grappling with the fallout of a deadly storm that struck over the weekend. The floods resulted in widespread damage and claimed at least 11 lives across KwaZulu-Natal. The South African Weather Service has forecasted more heavy rain for the region, prompting officials to advise the public to exercise caution. Local communities have been praised for their solidarity and efforts in ensuring safety for affected individuals.

In the tech world, Apple's Vision Pro headset is poised for pre-order release. The device introduces the novel Apple Immersive Video format and features new viewing environments in the Disney+ app. While the headset impresses with its technology and immersive capabilities, its high price point and the need for improvements in certain areas have been noted.

In a significant decision, the Supreme Court recently declined to hear the appeals from Apple and Epic Games regarding the antitrust case involving Apple's App Store. The ruling mandates that Apple must allow app developers to direct their customers to external payment methods through their apps, potentially affecting Apple's revenue significantly.

The University of KwaZulu Natal (UKZN) has received approximately 120,000 first-time undergraduate applications, but only has 9,000 places available. Popular courses include teaching, nursing, and social science degrees.

Lastly, a significant miscarriage of justice unfolded in the UK involving the Post Office and its sub-postmasters. A faulty IT system called Horizon showed erroneous financial shortfalls in various Post Office branches, leading to the wrongful conviction and financial ruin of around 700 sub-postmasters. The UK government has pledged swift legislative action to overturn the convictions.

That's all for today's news roundup. This has been Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest stories from around the world. Have a great day!
