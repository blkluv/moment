### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is September 18, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines:

First up, Bob van Dijk, the CEO of Prosus and Naspers, has unexpectedly resigned from his position and the board. Ervin Tu, Prosus' Group Chief Investment Officer, has been appointed as the interim chief executive. The reason for Van Dijk's departure is unknown. Prosus and Naspers expressed their gratitude for his leadership and wished him success in his future career. It's worth noting that Naspers became a leading global investor through a significant investment in Tencent back in 2001.

Moving on to sports, the South African rugby team, the Boks, had an impressive performance against Romania in the Rugby World Cup. They scored four tries in just 11 minutes and 13 seconds, setting a new record. Players like Makazole Mapimpi and Cobus Reinach stood out, both scoring hat-tricks. The Boks displayed their dominance in various areas of the game, including carrying the ball and turnovers. Despite not being the first-choice team, their depth was evident, and Deon Fourie seamlessly fit into the game as a backup hooker. Overall, it was a dominant performance by the Boks.

In another rugby match, Fiji's national team, the Flying Fijians, secured a historic 22-15 victory over Australia, their first win against the Wallabies in 69 years. Fiji showcased their skills and challenged Australia in all aspects of the game. The Wallabies struggled with discipline, kicking, and overall effectiveness. Semi Kuruvoli's kicking game and the team's performance were highlights for Fiji, while Australia's struggles revealed deeper issues within their squad. This unexpected outcome has made the upcoming match between Australia and Wales crucial for both teams in Pool C.

Shifting gears to Formula 1, George Russell, driving for Mercedes, crashed on the final lap of the Singapore Grand Prix, ending his pursuit of the team's first win of the season. Russell had been performing exceptionally well, qualifying on the front row and competing for the lead. However, a crash into the wall ultimately forced him out of the race. Mercedes defended their strategy, stating that it was the right decision and led to a podium finish for Lewis Hamilton. Russell expressed disappointment in himself and felt that he had let the team down.

On the technology front, iOS 17 is set to release today for iPhone XS and newer models. The update brings several new features, including StandBy, Contact Posters, and NameDrop. StandBy offers a full-screen display with glanceable information during charging, while Contact Posters allow for customizable screens for incoming calls. NameDrop enables proximity-based contact sharing. The update also includes improvements to autocorrect, offline map downloads for Apple Maps, and a consolidated Stickers Drawer. Siri activation has been simplified, requiring just the phrase "Siri." Additional features will be rolled out later in the year, presenting opportunities for application development.

Lastly, Vodacom, a mobile communications giant, suffered another defeat in its ongoing legal battle with "Please Call Me" inventor Nkosana Makate. The high court in Pretoria dismissed Vodacom's variation application, which aimed to amend a 2020 court ruling directing the company to provide Makate with copies of contracts. The ruling required Vodacom to supply copies of value-added service contracts with other service providers. The court also ruled that Makate should receive parts of a KPMG report, subject to a confidentiality regime. Vodacom's application for leave to appeal was also dismissed.

And that wraps up today's news. Stay informed, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News.
