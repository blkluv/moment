Hello, this is Erika with 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest stories on this February 5th, 2024.

Let's dive into our first story. A finance worker at a multinational corporation was recently scammed out of a whopping $25 million. The fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate the companyâ€™s chief financial officer and other staff members during a video conference call. Despite some initial suspicions, the worker was convinced by the realistic appearance and sound of the colleagues in the video call and transferred the funds. This case highlights the growing issue of deepfake technology being used for fraudulent purposes, including identity theft. It's a stern reminder of the urgent need for awareness and sophisticated countermeasures against such scams.

Moving on to the entertainment world, Amazon's new series "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine has received mixed reviews. The show attempts to blend the excitement of spy work with the struggles of a long-term relationship. However, critics feel that the chemistry between the leads is lacking, and the pacing of the show doesn't allow for the development of a compelling romantic foundation. Despite high-profile cameos and action sequences, the central relationship's lack of convincing passion seems to be a drawback.

In tech news, Showmax has launched a new app, leveraging Peacock's technology, promising a superior streaming experience. However, users are facing compatibility issues with smart TVs that previously supported the old app. Complaints have also been raised about ineffective customer support and the need to rebuild watchlists and profiles on the new platform. The transition to this new platform, rather than an upgrade, has sparked discontent among users, highlighting the challenges of adapting to evolving technology in the streaming landscape.

In music news, South African singer Tyla has made history at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the Grammy for Best African Music Performance for her song "Water." This is a significant milestone for Tyla and the introduction of the new Grammy category, emphasizing the Grammy's expanding recognition of global music genres. Tyla's win is a testament to the growing recognition of African music on the world stage.

In sports news, the 2026 World Cup final will be held at the MetLife Stadium in New York and New Jersey. This tournament, the largest in World Cup history, will feature 48 teams competing in 104 matches across 16 venues in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. The selection of MetLife Stadium, known for hosting significant NFL events, highlights its capacity to host world-class events.

At the 2024 Grammy Awards, Taylor Swift made history by becoming the first artist to win the Album of the Year award four times. The event was packed with memorable performances and appearances from music industry stars, including a rare public appearance by Celine Dion, and a memorable performance of "Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs.

Lastly, in business news, MultiChoice Group, a South African-based pay-television provider, has rejected an acquisition bid from France's Groupe Canal+. The board believes that the offer substantially undervalues the company. Meanwhile, Canal+ has increased its stake in MultiChoice, demonstrating its commitment to acquiring a significant share of the company.

And that's all for today's news. This is Erika with 'Just a Moment News', signing off. Stay informed and have a great day!
