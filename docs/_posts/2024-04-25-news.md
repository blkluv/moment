Hello, everyone! This is Erika, your host at Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines from around the world on this 25th day of April, 2024.

Let's start off in Cape Town, where a mega yacht, the Game Changer, has caused quite a stir. This 72-meter vessel, with its impressive capabilities and luxurious amenities, has captivated the city and sparked a flurry of speculation on social media. Despite the public's fascination, there's still uncertainty about its purpose and final destination in the area. Concurrently, Cape Town's maritime scene was also stirred by an incident involving a luxury cruise liner and a cargo carrier colliding due to strong winds in the harbor, highlighting the recent increase in maritime traffic in the area.

Moving on, we have news from the retail sector. Massmart is set to experiment with small-format Makro stores at four Game store locations within malls. These new stores will operate independently as Makro entities, complete with distinct merchandising and branding. The aim is not to replace Game stores but to enhance Makro's accessibility to a broader audience through mall-based outlets. Massmart anticipates launching this pilot in the latter half of the year.

In tech news, Apple has launched OpenELM (Open-source Efficient Language Models), a new suite of open-source large language models designed for local operation on devices. This initiative is part of Apple's strategy to embed more sophisticated AI functionalities directly into its hardware, enhancing privacy and processing speeds. Apple intends to integrate OpenELM into its upcoming iOS 18 release.

On the political front, President Joe Biden recently signed a bill that includes a provision potentially banning TikTok in the United States unless its parent company, ByteDance, sells the app within a designated timeframe. The decision has sparked considerable controversy, and TikTok has pledged to challenge the ban in court.

Next, we move to Saudi Arabia, where the country is pouring immense resources into A.I. and technology under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmanâ€™s Vision 2030. This strategic shift aims to diversify the oil-dependent economy, with large-scale projects and heavy investments in various sectors, positioning Saudi Arabia as a burgeoning hub in the global tech landscape.

In sports, 17-year-old Indian grandmaster Dommaraju Gukesh has made history by becoming the youngest player ever to qualify for the World Chess Championship's title match. Despite fierce competition, Gukesh triumphed over several top-ranked players, earning a spot to compete against Ding Liren of China.

Finally, in the realm of ancient history, DNA analysis is revolutionizing our understanding of the Avars, an enigmatic group that dominated much of Central and Eastern Europe for two hundred and fifty years starting in the mid-sixth century. DNA from four hundred and twenty-four individuals in Hungarian cemeteries has revealed intricate details about their social structure, shedding light on this mysterious ancient empire.

And that wraps up our news for today. This is Erika, your host at Just a Moment News, signing off. Stay informed, stay curious, and catch us again tomorrow for more news updates. Goodbye!
