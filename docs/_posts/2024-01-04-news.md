### Transcript

Hello, everyone! This is Erika on the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, bringing you the latest news stories on this 4th day of January, 2024. Let's dive right in.

First up, we're talking darts. Luke Humphries recently clinched his first PDC World Championship title, beating 16-year-old Luke Littler in a thrilling 7-4 victory. Despite trailing 4-2 at one point, Humphries rallied to win five consecutive sets. Littler, who had an impressive debut at the World Championship, became the youngest finalist in the tournament's history. Despite his loss, Littler has made a significant leap in the world rankings, jumping over 130 places into the top 32. The final was marked by high-quality play, with both players achieving impressive averages. This victory certainly solidifies Humphries' place as world number one.

Next, we're heading to Cape Town for some cricket news. The pitch conditions during the Test cricket series between South Africa and India have been making headlines, and not for the best reasons. The pitches have been criticized for their extreme conditions, making even routine plays risky and causing batters to struggle. In a recent match, 23 wickets fell in one day, a rarity in Test cricket, leading to questions about the pitch quality. Despite the challenging conditions, both South African and Indian bowlers have been able to exploit the pitch to their advantage, making the match unpredictable and more of a "lottery" than a test of skill.

Now, let's talk about something a little different. The King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, is being virtually revived for a new immersive concert called "Elvis Evolution." The show, set to debut in London later this year, will feature holographic projections of Presley, based on thousands of his photos and home videos. The show is being produced by British immersive entertainment company Layered Reality, and they promise a "jaw-dropping concert experience" with a life-sized digital Elvis performing iconic moments in musical history on a UK stage for the first time.

In legal news, a U.S. judge recently unsealed names associated with a 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell, related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The unsealed documents reveal a list of individuals, including prominent figures like Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and others. These names are not exclusively Epstein's clients; the list also includes victims, former employees, and people who traveled on Epstein's plane, as well as journalists and other associates.

SpaceX has launched its first satellites capable of connecting directly to cell phones. This follows approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for a 180-day test period, in partnership with T-Mobile and other telecom companies globally. These tests aim to provide 4G connectivity to unmodified smartphones using 840 satellites.

Mozilla, the company historically known for its Firefox browser, is pivoting towards AI. The company has ventured into the AI domain with Mozilla.ai, aimed at leveraging open-source large language models and ensuring their alignment with Mozillaâ€™s core values. This initiative is about creating accessible, privacy-sensitive, and affordable AI solutions.

Researchers have created detailed maps of human sea activity, uncovering extensive industrial operations previously untracked. This research, led by Global Fishing Watch and published in Nature, reveals that a significant percentage of the world's industrial fishing vessels and transport and energy vessels are not publicly monitored, posing a challenge to global conservation efforts.

Lastly, we're heading underground to Somerset West, where an innovative project called Earthbox is offering a deep connection with Mother Earth. Earthbox, an underground installation, is envisioned as a place for deep reflection and personal contemplation. Its design eschews concrete and steel, instead exposing the Earth's organic structure. Despite its complexity and the challenges posed by the excavation, the project is unique and significant, offering a blend of art installation and immersive experience.

And that's all for today's news. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow.
