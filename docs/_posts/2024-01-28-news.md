Hello, everyone. This is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on January 28, 2024. Let's dive into today's top stories.

Our first story takes us to the world of tennis. Aryna Sabalenka recently clinched her second consecutive Australian Open title, and her victory perfectly captured the spirit of the tournament. Sabalenka's powerful game on the court and her celebratory dance-offs off the court symbolize the blend of dedication and enjoyment that characterizes the Australian Open. This year, the tournament itself underwent significant changes, including new policies and formats aimed at enhancing the spectator experience. Despite some initial skepticism, these changes were largely successful, contributing to a record attendance. The success of these changes suggests that other major tennis tournaments might adopt similar policies in the future, marking a potential shift in the traditional tennis experience.

In wrestling news, Cody Rhodes has won the Royal Rumble for the second year in a row, setting up a highly anticipated match against Roman Reigns at WrestleMania. While the Men's Rumble match lacked some excitement and memorable moments, the Women's Rumble, won by Bayley, was considered more engaging. The event also featured a notable match between Kevin Owens and Logan Paul for the United States Championship, marked by a disqualification finish due to the use of brass knuckles. Despite some dampened impact due to predictable outcomes, fans are eagerly awaiting Cody's attempt to dethrone Reigns.

Turning to the world of finance, the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX cryptocurrency empire resulted in the loss of billions of dollars, but not everyone lost out. Rashit Makhat, a jujitsu champion from Kazakhstan, emerged as a significant beneficiary, having sold his stake in Genesis Digital Assets for about $500 million to Bankman-Friedâ€™s hedge fund shortly before FTX's collapse. While Bankman-Fried now awaits sentencing for stealing customer money, Makhat has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

In royal news, the principality of Monaco is currently embroiled in a financial scandal involving Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II. Allegations of extravagant spending by the princess and undisclosed financial dealings by the prince have been made public. These revelations, coupled with ongoing speculations about the strain in their relationship, have put the royal couple under intense scrutiny.

In Cape Town, South Africa, a large-scale eviction has left hundreds, primarily foreign nationals, homeless. The eviction, executed by the South African Police Service and immigration officials, followed a court order instructing occupants of specific properties to vacate by the end of last year. The abrupt displacement of these long-term residents has highlighted the complexities and human impact of urban eviction processes.

In entertainment news, the Amazon Prime Video series "Expats," starring Nicole Kidman, is garnering attention. The mystery drama, centered around the disappearance of a young boy in Hong Kong, explores themes like sexism, classism, home, and family over six episodes. The series has been praised for its patient storytelling style and its empathetic portrayal of its characters and the wider context of Hong Kong.

Finally, in gaming news, Netflix's venture into the gaming industry appears to be gaining traction. Their gaming downloads soared by 180% in 2023, reaching 81.2 million worldwide, thanks to the addition of popular titles like GTA: San Andreas. Despite some stagnation, Netflix's gaming division continues to expand, with nearly 90 games in development.

That's all for today's news. I'm Erika, and you've been listening to 'Just a Moment News.' Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow.
