### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest news headlines and summaries for today, December 9, 2023.

First up, we have a story about Mountain Dew and Twitch. Mountain Dew has launched an AI-powered marketing program called MTN DEW RAID on Twitch. The program scans Twitch streams tagged with #Gaming to find Mountain Dew products and logos. Streamers with these visible will be invited to join the program, and if they agree, the AI will continue monitoring their stream for Mountain Dew presence. Streamers who keep the product in view may be featured on Twitch's homepage, Mountain Dew's Twitch channel, or receive coaching from a professional streamer. Some users have criticized the program for offering only exposure and not financial compensation, comparing it to a surveillance system and expressing concerns about future marketing tactics by large corporations.

Next, we have a review of the film "Leave the World Behind." Directed by Sam Esmail and based on Rumaan Alam's novel, the film features Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke as a wealthy couple seeking an escape from society. Their family vacation is interrupted by strange events, including an oil tanker accident and a blackout. The arrival of the homeowners adds to the tension. The film explores themes of racial tension and societal collapse with a blend of dark humor and bizarre occurrences. It has received mixed reviews, with praise for its unique approach and Julia Roberts' performance.

In sports news, Nick Kyrgios has announced that he will not participate in the 2024 Australian Open due to a wrist injury. Kyrgios has had a challenging year, including knee surgery and a premature return that worsened his condition. Despite his absence from the tournament, he plans to stay engaged by commentating and participating in special activities. Wrist injuries have been a trend among tennis players and have had a significant impact on their careers. Kyrgios, formerly ranked No.13 in the world, maintains a protected ranking of No.21 and is likely to receive wildcard offers from various tournaments upon recovery.

Moving on, the Interactive Advertising Bureau South Africa (IAB SA) has identified Media24, Broad Media, and Arena Holdings as the leading online publishers in the country. This ranking is based on their recent readership statistics. IAB SA has partnered with dY/dX to establish a standardized metric for the industry. The partnership aims to enhance the measurement of online publishing using technologies like APIs, JSON, and Google Analytics. The IAB SA Industry Measurement dashboard offers a comprehensive view of online audience engagement across various publishers in South Africa.

In science news, the FDA has approved two gene therapies for sickle cell disease: Casgevy and Lyfgenia. Casgevy is a CRISPR/Cas9-based treatment that reactivates fetal hemoglobin production to prevent cell deformation. Lyfgenia uses a Lentiviral vector to introduce genes for a modified, anti-sickling hemoglobin. Both treatments have shown effectiveness in managing the disease and are approved for patients 12 years and older.

Lastly, McDonald's Corporation is embarking on its most aggressive expansion plan to date, with the aim of increasing its global restaurant count to 50,000 by 2027. This growth includes the addition of 2,000 restaurants by the end of this year. The plan encompasses traditional dine-in restaurants, drive-thru, and delivery-only formats. McDonald's is also focusing on enhancing its core offerings, digital channels, and marketing efforts. The company is projected to reach systemwide sales of $130 billion this year, with a strong financial outlook for the future.
