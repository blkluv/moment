Hello, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News.' I'm Erika, and today is May 27, 2024. Let's delve into some of today's notable headlines and stories.

Starting off, President Cyril Ramaphosa's recent address to the nation has sparked a wave of criticism. Just two days before a crucial election, Ramaphosa used this platform to urge South Africans to vote, while also reflecting on the successes and challenges of his administration. Critics, including prominent figures like Mmusi Maimane and Geoffrey York, have accused him of misusing the presidential broadcast for electoral purposes, calling it an abuse of power. During his speech, Ramaphosa not only praised the preparations by the Independent Electoral Commission but also emphasized the importance of adhering to democratic principles amidst concerns of electoral interference.

Moving to sports, the West Indies cricket team recently completed a clean sweep against the Proteas in a T20I series, with a commanding performance that culminated in an eight-wicket victory at Sabina Park. The West Indies chased down a target of one hundred and sixty-four runs with significant time to spare. Key performances included a destructive sixty-nine runs from twenty-six balls by Johnson Charles. Despite a fighting seventy-seven from South Africa's Rassie van der Dussen, the Proteas captain acknowledged the need for improvement as they look ahead to the T20 World Cup.

In football news, Southampton has secured their promotion back to the Premier League after defeating Leeds United in the Championship playoff final. The only goal of the match was scored by Adam Armstrong, leading to a 1-0 victory. This win not only marks a successful season under manager Russell Martin but also promises a significant financial boost, potentially reaching up to one hundred and seventy million pounds in new revenue.

Turning to an incident in the skies, a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Dublin experienced severe turbulence over Turkey, leading to injuries for twelve individuals, including six crew members. This event underscores the unpredictable nature of air travel and the importance of safety measures like keeping seat belts fastened.

In media trends, a significant shift in South Africa's viewing habits has been noted. A decline in traditional TV viewership is observed, with more people turning to streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, and Showmax. This trend reflects broader changes in global media consumption, challenging traditional broadcasters to adapt.

Lastly, a remarkable discovery in the Czech Republic where a woman stumbled upon a cache of over two thousand one hundred fifty silver coins from the Middle Ages in Kutn√° Hora. This find, which dates back to a period of political turmoil, is considered one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in recent years.
