Good morning, and welcome to "Just a Moment News." I'm Erika, and today is December 3, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, Europe experienced severe travel disruptions due to heavy snow and freezing temperatures following deadly early-season storms. Munich and Dublin airports were particularly affected, with hundreds of flights canceled and travel not expected to resume until Sunday. The snow impacted various regions, including southern Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. London, Vienna, and Zurich airports reported delays, while Glasgow Airport temporarily suspended flights. In Austria and Switzerland, avalanche warnings were issued. The UK saw cancellations of several soccer matches. In Ukraine, snowstorms resulted in 10 deaths and widespread power outages, with similar fatalities reported in Moldova. Meanwhile, in Hawaii, the Mauna Kea summit received its first snow of the season. The Pacific Northwest in the U.S. is also experiencing heavy snow in high elevations, raising concerns about flood risks. The National Weather Service predicts continued rain and snow in the Pacific Northwest, Rockies, and Great Basin regions through the weekend. New York is expected to have more rain with temperatures in the low 50s.

Moving on, tensions are rising between Targaryens in the first teaser for Season 2 of HBO's "House of the Dragon." The teaser, revealed at CCXP23 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, anticipates the Targaryen civil war, known as the Dance of Dragons. Set 200 years before "Game of Thrones," the show follows the decline of House Targaryen and the political strife that arises from King Viserys I's choice of his daughter Rhaenyra over his brother Daemon as heir. The teaser suggests typical Westeros conflicts with dragons, battles, and political intrigue. Season 2 promises to intensify the Targaryen conflict and is expected to premiere in the summer of 2024 on Max.

Next, the upcoming cricket tour of India to South Africa is set to significantly boost Cricket South Africa's finances. Despite the absence of star players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, the tour is projected to generate up to 1.3 billion rand for CSA. This income, mainly from broadcast deals, is crucial for the financial health of CSA, especially considering their recent financial losses. The tour's value far exceeds that of other tours, highlighting the substantial revenue that Indian cricket tours bring. The financial gains from this tour are vital for CSA, especially in the backdrop of their financial struggles in recent years.

In a heartwarming story, Zulu weapons are heading home after decades in Ireland. Isabella Walsh fulfilled her late father's wish by returning four Zulu assegais and a couple of knobkieries to South Africa. Her father, a former curator of the Limerick Museum, had acquired these artifacts in the 1980s and requested their repatriation before his death. With the help of Dr. Christos Tsirogiannis, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, Isabella contacted the embassies of the respective countries, and the South African embassy in Dublin received the items. Isabella appreciated their history but believed they belonged in their place of origin.

Moving on, Robben Island, a World Heritage Site and tourist attraction where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, seems to represent missed opportunities in South Africa. The tour, costing 600 rand, has not changed significantly in 20 years. Despite cleanliness, the island and prison give an impression of faded relevance, with failed development plans and controversies like mismanagement and a questionable ferry tender. The tour also covers the resilience of political prisoners and Mandela's garden, now poorly maintained, reflecting a neglect of Mandela's legacy and the island's potential.

Lastly, scammers are increasingly using the images and names of South African public figures, such as Elon Musk and President Cyril Ramaphosa, in various online scams. These scams aim to steal money or personal data by leveraging the perceived legitimacy that comes with famous personalities. The Department Of Communications and Digital Technologies has issued public warnings about these scams.

That's all for today's headlines. Thank you for joining me on "Just a Moment News." I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
