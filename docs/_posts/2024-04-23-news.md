### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the top stories for today, April 23, 2024.

Let's dive right into it.

First up, Meta Platforms Inc., Facebook's parent company, has made a significant announcement. They've decided to open up their Meta Quest headset operating system to other hardware manufacturers. This is a strategic move by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to expand the company's presence in the augmented and virtual reality sectors. Companies can now develop their own headsets using Meta's operating system, which aims to lessen Meta's dependency on major mobile OS providers like Apple and Google. Microsoft and Lenovo are among the early partners in this initiative.

Next, Apple is reportedly on the verge of a major football deal with Fifa. The tech giant is close to securing global television rights for a new month-long club soccer tournament. This deal, potentially valued at a billion U.S. dollars, would give Apple's streaming service a competitive edge in the ongoing battle among streaming platforms to secure broadcasting rights for major sports events.

Moving on to the music scene, Taylor Swift has done it again. Her latest album, "The Tortured Poets Department," has set a new record on Spotify by amassing over three hundred million streams within a single day. Swift has also become the highest-streamed artist in one day on Spotify. The album's first track, "Fortnight," featuring Post Malone, also broke records as the most-streamed song in a day on Spotify.

In sports news, Wales is set to host rugby world champions South Africa in the Autumn Nations Series in November. The series will kick off with Fiji as the opening opposition at the Principality Stadium on November 10, followed by the Wallabies a week later, and then the world champion Springboks on November 23.

In other sports news, Conor McGregor, a major figure in the UFC, is set to potentially break a new record for the highest live gate with his upcoming fight at UFC 303 on June 29, 2024. McGregor, who is returning to the ring for the first time in three years after a severe leg injury, is slated to fight Michael Chandler. The event's ticket sales are drawing significant attention, with VIP packages showing price points as high as twelve thousand dollars for premium access and experiences.

For those of you looking for something to stream this week, there are several options across different platforms. Showmax has a documentary on skateboarding legend Tony Hawk, while Netflix's "Baby Reindeer" is a black comedy about a comedian's harrowing experience with a stalker. Disney Plus offers "Feud: Capote vs The Swans," a drama about Truman Capote's fallout with New York's elite, and Prime Video has "Fallout," a darkly humorous adaptation of the popular video game set in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles.

Lastly, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, the most distant human-made object in existence, has resumed transmitting usable data about its onboard engineering systems for the first time since November. The Voyager engineering team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California achieved this milestone through inventive troubleshooting.

And that wraps up our news for today. This has been Erika from 'Just a Moment News'. Have a great day!
