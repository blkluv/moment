First up, Eskom, South Africa's state-owned power utility, is facing public criticism for proceeding with a tender for a new logo and corporate identity. Despite financial challenges and ongoing power outages, Eskom is moving forward with the redesign as part of its alignment with the Department of Public Enterprises' roadmap for unbundling the entity. The Democratic Alliance has criticized the tender as an unnecessary vanity project, calling for its cancellation. However, Eskom remains committed to creating independent identities for its subsidiaries.

In sports news, Siya Kolisi, the former captain of the South African Rugby team, made a successful debut with Racing 92 in France. Kolisi's performance helped Racing 92 secure a 32-10 victory over La Rochelle, propelling them to the top of the French Top 14 table. Kolisi's influence on the field and his advice to teammates during the match showcased his leadership skills. The victory was a significant milestone for Kolisi and further solidifies his reputation in French rugby.

Moving on to entertainment news, the filmmakers of "F9: The Fast Saga" have been fined $1 million after a stuntman suffered a severe injury during filming. The stuntman, Joe Watts, fell head-first onto concrete, resulting in a skull fracture and brain damage. The court found that health and safety protocols were lacking, and the film's team was criticized for a last-minute change in the stunt and inadequate safety measures. Despite the incident, "F9" achieved commercial success upon its release.

In boxing news, South African boxer Kevin Lerena has claimed the WBC Interim Bridgerweight championship after a unanimous decision victory over German Senad Gashi. Lerena's win marks an important milestone in his career, and he is now set to face the winner of the bout between the current WBC bridgerweight champion and a contender. Lerena's success positions him for more high-profile fights in the future.

Finally, in the world of television, Brie Larson discusses her role in the series "Lessons in Chemistry." Larson, who is also an executive producer of the show, describes her character as a departure from her previous work, emphasizing love and positivity. The series explores the balance between love and intellect, offering Larson a unique opportunity to portray a narrative that is both loving and sweet. Larson's involvement in the series stems from her deep connection to the character and the novel's tone.

In international news, secret warnings about research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology predating the pandemic have come to light. Concerns were raised in late 2017 about the lab's capability and plans to study Ebola, potentially through reverse engineering. The warnings sparked debates about the collaboration's future and raised concerns about national security and the potential for dual-use research. This situation highlights the tension between scientific collaboration and security risks, particularly in partnerships with autocratic countries.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining us on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
