### Transcript

Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is September 8, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have the Rugby World Cup Week 1 preview. The highly anticipated tournament kicks off with hosts France taking on the All Blacks in what promises to be an intense opening match. France will be facing the pressure of playing at home without their star fly-half, Romain Ntamack. Both teams will be focusing on the scrum and set-piece, with France's Antoine Dupont being a key player to watch. The weekend will also feature other exciting matches like England vs. Argentina, Scotland vs. South Africa, and Wales vs. Fiji. It's shaping up to be a World Cup filled with intriguing matchups and star-studded line-ups.

Moving on, 'That '70s Show' actor Danny Masterson has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for raping two women in 2003. Masterson, who was a prominent member of the Church of Scientology, was convicted of using his status to evade accountability. The victims, who were also members of the church, have denied any conspiracy against Masterson or the church. Masterson's defense plans to appeal the sentence, citing "significant evidentiary and constitutional issues." The Church of Scientology has denied discouraging the reporting of criminal conduct.

In other news, comedian Trevor Noah is set to be paid 33 million Rand for starring in a 5-minute advertisement promoting South Africa as a tourist destination. The decision has sparked controversy among parliamentarians, but Tourism Minister Patricia de Lille clarified that the funding is coming from the Tourism Business Council of South Africa, not state funds. The project has been compared to a contentious deal with Tottenham Hotspur. De Lille defended the decision and encouraged any queries to be directed to the Tourism Business Council of South Africa.

Next, popular South African food franchise Spur Steak Ranches has undergone a major brand refresh. After 27 years, the franchise has updated its brand identity, including a new logo and interior features. The pilot store for the new look, Amigo Spur, has reopened at the Vaal Mall, with other locations scheduled for redesigns. The rebrand aims to maintain the brand's child-friendly atmosphere while introducing new elements.

In sports news, South African athlete Christelle Hattingh secured a third-place finish in her age category at the Powerman Zofingen Duathlon Championships in Switzerland. Hattingh's accomplishment highlights the rising prominence of South African female endurance runners on the global stage. This comes shortly after Toni McCann became the first South African to win the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc OCC in France.

Lastly, Virgin Active, a global fitness industry leader, is investing over 430-million Rand in expanding its offerings in South Africa. The company aims to provide comprehensive wellness solutions, including fitness, nutrition, and mental well-being. They have launched a new smartphone app and partnered with Epic Padel to open padel courts in their facilities. Additionally, Virgin Active has invested in backup power solutions to ensure operational continuity during power outages. However, they are currently facing allegations of unfair competition from Body Action Gym.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
