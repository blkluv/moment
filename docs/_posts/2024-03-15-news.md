Hello, this is Erika, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News' on this fine day of March 15, 2024. Let's dive into today's top stories.

So, South Africa is currently grappling with widespread internet issues, and it's all due to multiple undersea cable breaks between the country and Europe. This has affected network providers, including Vodacom, and has had a significant impact on the West Africa Cable System, MainOne, Sat-3, and Ace cables. This disruption, which is the second of its kind in just seven months, is causing quite the headache, especially with the recent severance of the Seacom cable in the Red Sea. It's a stark reminder of the vulnerability of the global internet infrastructure and the importance of investing in infrastructure redundancy and exploring alternative data transmission technologies.

In another development, the relationship between Google and South African publisher Caxton has evolved into a competitive one. Caxton Chairman Paul Jenkins has pointed out the significant content and value that local news provides to digital platforms like Google, but he feels there's a lack of reciprocal benefit. This situation highlights the broader debate on the balance between digital platform dominance and the sustainability of traditional news outlets.

On a lighter note, Eben Etzebeth, the Springbok lock, has been crowned SA Rugby’s best for the second consecutive year. His exceptional skill set and game-deciding impact, particularly evident during the Rugby World Cup 2023, have set him apart from other players. The awards ceremony also celebrated other significant achievements within South African rugby, underlining the broad and diverse success of South African rugby across different levels and categories.

In space news, SpaceX's latest Starship test flight marked a significant improvement over its predecessors, achieving a full-duration ascent burn for the first time. Despite the mission ending prematurely, the test represents a pivotal moment for SpaceX, demonstrating the Starship's potential for future space missions. The FAA's approval with fewer corrective actions compared to previous tests underscores SpaceX's progress in addressing safety and design concerns.

In a fascinating historical discovery, an astrolabe dating to the 11th century was found at the Fondazione Museo Miniscalchi-Erizzo in Verona, Italy. Historian Federica Gigante of the University of Cambridge noted that this wasn’t just an incredibly rare, ancient object but a powerful record of scientific exchange between Muslims, Jews, and Christians over nearly a millennium.

In tech news, Apple Inc. has acquired the Canadian artificial intelligence startup DarwinAI. This move is expected to bolster its AI capabilities, particularly with an eye towards a major push into generative AI in 2024. The acquisition brings onboard DarwinAI's notable personnel and technology, which is expected to enhance Apple's offerings across various industries.

Finally, Microsoft is broadening the reach of its Copilot Pro subscription by making it available in a total of two hundred and twenty-two countries. To attract subscribers to its AI-driven vision, Microsoft is offering a free one-month trial of Copilot Pro. The company has further expansion plans, including incorporating Copilot Pro into Microsoft's mobile applications and extending Copilot access to a wider range of business customers.

And that wraps up our news for today. Don't forget to join us tomorrow for more top stories. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Have a great day!
