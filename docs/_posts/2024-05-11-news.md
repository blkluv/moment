Hello, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest headlines and stories on this 11th of May, 2024. Let's dive into some of the significant news from around the globe today.

Starting off, there's a severe G4 geomagnetic storm expected to hit Earth this weekend, triggered by five solar eruptions. This is the first such warning issued by the US Space Weather Prediction Center since January 2005. The effects, which could last from late Friday through Sunday, might include blackouts and disruptions to navigation and high-frequency radio systems. This storm originates from a large sunspot cluster on the sun and could enhance the visibility of auroras across large parts of Asia, Europe, and North America. According to the South African National Space Agency, this increased solar activity is part of the sun's eleven-year cycle, with a peak anticipated in 2025.

In other news, the rebuilding of South Africa's Parliament building, which was damaged by fire in 2022, is now estimated to cost three billion Rand. The new design will feature a biophilic concept inspired by the protea, South Africaâ€™s national flower. The project's timeline has been extended, with completion now expected in April 2026. To keep the public informed and engaged, Parliament has launched a dedicated website and a WhatsApp chatbot.

Moving on, there's a new trend in grocery store marketing in South Africa involving "shelfobots". These robots, which present products using a robotic arm and audio system, have reportedly boosted sales significantly. Despite their success, this raises questions about the broader implications of such persistent marketing tactics in retail environments.

Over at Apple, there's a major upgrade coming to Siri. Triggered by the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Apple's top software executives are focusing on enhancing Siri's conversational abilities and integrating AI more deeply across its business. This includes increasing iPhone memory and exploring licensing AI technologies from other companies.

Speaking of OpenAI, they are set to announce updates to ChatGPT and GPT-4 next Monday. Although initially rumored to be launching a search service to compete with Google, OpenAI has confirmed that the upcoming updates will not include a new search service but will feature new capabilities like a vocally interactive chatbot and object recognition in images.

Lastly, Fiona Harvey, identified as the stalker in Netflix's "Baby Reindeer", spoke out in an interview with Piers Morgan. This marked her first on-camera discussion since the series' release, where she faced significant public scrutiny and death threats. The series dramatizes the experiences of comedian Richard Gadd with a serial stalker, sparking widespread speculation about the real identities involved.

And in a lighter vein, a virtual portal between New York City and Dublin has turned into a dynamic venue for social interactions, including flirtatious exchanges. Installed at key locations in both cities, this portal has facilitated not just cultural exchanges but also personal and romantic connections.

That wraps up our news for today. Thank you for tuning in to 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, and I'll be back with more stories and updates soon. Stay informed and stay curious!
