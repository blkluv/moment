### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for December 1, 2023. Let's dive into today's stories.

First up, we have a financial crunch faced by Eskom, South Africa's power utility. They are on track to overshoot their emergency diesel budget. With only about 3.6 billion Rand left in their diesel budget for the current financial year, concerns are rising as they spent a record-breaking 24.3 billion Rand on diesel for their emergency generation fleet. This increased reliance on diesel is due to frequent breakdowns in their aging coal-fired power fleet. Despite adding capacity to the grid, Eskom still faces high levels of load shedding and substantial diesel usage. The utility cannot borrow more money and will have to manage budget overruns internally. This situation poses significant implications for South Africa's energy stability and Eskom's financial health.

Next, we have the one-year anniversary of ChatGPT, an AI technology that has revolutionized the interaction between the public and artificial intelligence. ChatGPT's user-friendly interface has made AI more accessible to the mainstream, leading to a race among tech giants to develop similar technologies. However, concerns about AI bias and misinformation have also been raised. The impact of ChatGPT is expected to bring significant changes to various industries, although the long-term effects on productivity and job markets remain uncertain. The AI industry is anticipated to grow even faster, with major companies pushing the boundaries of AI technology.

Moving on, there are rumors that Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May may be leaving "The Grand Tour." A BBC report suggests that the future of the show is uncertain, but there is potential for a new version with different hosts. The trio recently completed filming a special in Zimbabwe, set to air next year. This follows the indefinite pause of "Top Gear" filming due to an injury to Freddie Flintoff. Clarkson, Hammond, and May have been known for their controversial and entertaining style, and their departure would mark the end of an era for the show.

In weather news, South Africa experienced the hottest November on record. A recent heatwave broke temperature records, leading to increased electricity demand and contributing to load shedding. The South African Weather Service forecasts above-normal temperatures countrywide over the summer, with the possibility of drier and warmer conditions due to the El Niño weather phenomenon. Caution is advised as the full extent of El Niño's impact on rainfall and drier conditions is still uncertain.

Lastly, we have unfortunate news about The Big Issue, a South African job creation project. They may face closure following a 600,000 Rand loss from a cyber scam. The scam involved a fraudulent email that led to funds being transferred to a fake account. The funds were already withdrawn when the scam was discovered. The Big Issue is seeking public donations to recover the loss and continue their operations. This incident highlights the prevalence of cybercrime in South Africa and the need for protective measures such as 2 Factor Authentication.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
