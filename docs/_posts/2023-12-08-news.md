### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines and summaries for today, December 8, 2023.

First up, we have news from South Africa, where consumer confidence during the festive season is at its lowest point in over two decades, according to FNB. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index has fallen to negative seventeen, signaling tighter consumer spending during the holiday shopping season. This decline is more severe than the negative twelve level recorded in 2020. The outlook on the national economy is also bleak, with various crises, high interest rates, and inflation contributing to economic uncertainty.

Moving on, researchers have discovered the oldest-known mosquito fossils, dating back 130 million years. These male mosquitoes, preserved in amber, had elongated mouthparts for blood-sucking, a trait now seen only in females. This finding suggests that early mosquitoes, regardless of sex, were blood-feeders. The study indicates that mosquitoes evolved from non-blood-consuming insects and that the emergence of flowering plants might have influenced this dietary shift.

Next, we have a review of the BritBox series "Archie," which attempts to explore the life of Cary Grant but falls short in depth and insight. Despite its ambitious goals and a central performance by Jason Isaacs, the series is criticized for its lack of focus, superficiality, and erratic storytelling. The portrayal of various Hollywood figures is seen as lacking depth and accuracy, and the series fails to offer meaningful insights into Grant's life and significance in Hollywood.

In sports news, golfer Jon Rahm, the world's third-ranked golfer and two-time major champion, has reportedly signed with LIV Golf in a record-breaking deal worth over Â£450 million ($860m). Rahm's decision raises questions about his eligibility for future Ryder Cup events and adds a new dynamic to the ongoing negotiations and potential merger between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

Moving on to politics, Police Minister Bheki Cele is facing criticism for a costly Rugby World Cup trip to France, where the South African Police Service (SAPS) spent nearly half a million rand for his executive assistant's travel. The expenditure has been condemned as unnecessary and a misuse of taxpayer funds. This controversy comes amid broader concerns about SAPS's struggles with resource limitations and high crime rates.

Lastly, in business news, Dan Marokane is expected to be appointed as the new CEO of Eskom, South Africa's struggling power utility. Marokane will have the task of reviving the utility, which has been plagued by nationwide electricity outages. The energy crisis has had a significant impact on the country's economic growth and may affect the governing ANC's support in the upcoming national elections.

That's all for today's headlines and summaries. Stay informed and have a great day ahead! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
