### Transcript

Good morning and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 1st, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, an unexpected origin story of Egypt's Great Sphinx has been unearthed by researchers at New York University. They conducted an experiment using soft clay and harder materials to simulate the erosive effect of fast-flowing water acting as wind. The findings suggest that natural erosive forces could be responsible for the formation of complex shapes like the Sphinx. This study also provides valuable information for geologists studying rock formations. It adds another layer of understanding to the debate surrounding the origins of the Sphinx and similar structures.

Next, Comcast and Sky are teaming up to take on Netflix in Africa. Showmax, Africa's leading TV streaming player, is undergoing a major overhaul backed by Comcast to better compete with Netflix. The revamped Showmax 2.0 aims to increase monetization and protect its parent company MultiChoice's control over lucrative sports broadcasting rights in Africa. While Showmax faces an uphill battle against Netflix, the addition of premium international content from global partners like NBCUniversal and Sky will make it more attractive to consumers.

In sports news, Saudi Arabia is set to be the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA World Cup after Australia withdrew its bid. FIFA's expedited and restrictive bidding process played a key role in narrowing the field, favoring Saudi Arabia's existing infrastructure and geopolitical influence. The kingdom's ascension as the probable host has garnered criticism from human rights organizations, but it avoids the risk of corruption scandals that marred previous selection processes.

Moving on, Eskom, South Africa's state-owned power utility, has reported a net loss of 23.9 billion rand in the financial year that ended in March 2023. This widening loss is attributed to the implementation of the worst power cuts on record, which have curbed economic growth and fueled public frustration. The government has pledged to split Eskom into three subsidiaries to improve its efficiency and financial situation.

In the world of football, Lionel Messi has won the Ballon d'Or for an unprecedented eighth time. This makes him the first MLS-based player to win the prestigious award. Messi's victory is attributed to his performance in the 2022 World Cup, where he led Argentina to a championship win. Other notable awards were given out during the ceremony, including the Ballon d'Or FÃ©minin and the Yashin Trophy for the best goalkeeper.

Lastly, Fontainebleau Las Vegas is set to revolutionize the city's hotel landscape when it opens on December 13th. This $3.7-billion venture aims to set a new standard for luxury with its 3,644 rooms and high-end suites. The resort also brings innovation to the food and beverage sector, partnering with Groot Hospitality to import Fontainebleau Miami Beach's iconic nightclub and restaurants. With its blend of history, luxury, and innovation, Fontainebleau Las Vegas is expected to become a game-changer in the city known for its opulence.

That's all for today's headlines. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
