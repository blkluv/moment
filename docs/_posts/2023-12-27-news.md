### Transcript

Hello, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', and today is December 27, 2023. Let's dive into the latest headlines. 

First up, we're talking about the Test match between South Africa and India at SuperSport Park, Centurion. Kagiso Rabada, South Africa's premier fast bowler, really showed his skills with an incredible five-wicket haul, his 14th career highlight. Thanks to Rabada's exceptional performance, India was restricted to 208 for 8 in 59 overs. Despite some fielding hiccups from the South African team, Rabada's consistent line and length on a bowler-friendly surface kept the pressure on. KL Rahul from India also deserves a mention for his solid unbeaten 70, steering India to a somewhat stable position.

In other news, a tragic loss in the world of cinema. South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun, known for his role in the Oscar-winning film "Parasite" and Apple TV+'s series "Dr. Brain," was found dead at the age of 48, an apparent suicide. His death is amidst an ongoing investigation into allegations of illegal drug use. Lee was a versatile actor, with a career spanning television, film, and theater. He is survived by his wife, actress Jeon Hye-jin, and their two sons.

Moving on to the streaming industry, Amazon has announced that starting January 29th, their Prime Video service will include "limited advertisements" in movies and TV shows. The current Prime membership fee remains unchanged and customers can pay an additional $2.99 per month for an ad-free experience. Amazon assures that the number of ads will be significantly less than on linear TV and other streaming services. This move aligns with the industry trend where services like Disney Plus, Hulu, and Netflix are introducing ads on their lower-priced plans.

In the world of film, "Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire," directed by Zack Snyder, has made a strong debut on Netflix, becoming the most viewed title following its release on December 21st. The film garnered 23.9 million views in its first few days. The film's success will be truly tested in its second week, which is critical for movies on Netflix, as it reflects the full week of viewing and the impact of word-of-mouth.

In tech news, Microsoft has launched its ChatGPT-like app, Copilot, on Android, with the iOS version soon to follow. The app, essentially a rebranded Bing Chat, distinguishes itself by focusing primarily on chat functionalities and integrating features like DALL-E 3. The app is versatile and free, with Microsoft intending to keep it that way, enhancing its appeal with support for third-party plugins.

Lastly, we look at the film "Ferrari," starring Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari. The film showcases Enzo's dedication to creating coveted racecars, juxtaposing his professional prowess with his challenging personal life. Despite the character's emotional distance and questionable ethics, director Michael Mann's immersive portrayal of auto-racing and Enzo's intricate character holds the audience.

And that's all for today's news. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' signing off. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow.
