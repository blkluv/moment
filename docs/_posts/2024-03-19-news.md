Hello, welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is March 19, 2024. Let's dive right into today's news stories. 

First up, Apple is making significant strides in the field of artificial intelligence. The tech giant's recent research paper, "MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training," details advancements in multimodal AI, which involves training models on both text and images. This approach is improving AI performance across various benchmarks, including image captioning and visual question answering. Apple's commitment to AI is demonstrated by a planned annual investment of a billion dollars, aiming to incorporate AI across its product range. We're all eager to see what's next for Apple in the AI space.

In entertainment news, YouTube star MrBeast, also known as Jimmy Donaldson, is partnering with Prime Video for a new reality series called "Beast Games." The show promises an unprecedented $5 million prize, making it the largest single prize in television and streaming history. Donaldson's move to Prime Video indicates a shift in content strategy, allowing him to focus more on storytelling and quality over crafting content around YouTube's title and thumbnail constraints.

Next, NVIDIA is giving enterprise developers more tools for Apple Vision Pro. The company has developed a software framework that lets developers upload and stream their 3D content directly from the cloud. This bypasses the need for local processing on the Apple Vision Pro's M2 processor and offers a new level of interactive and immersive digital experiences.

In legal news, former President Donald Trump has been ordered to pay $464 million in a New York civil fraud case. Trump has stated that obtaining such a large bond is nearly unattainable, and his legal team has yet to find a bonding company willing to guarantee the amount. This situation could lead to the liquidation of Trump's real estate assets if he fails to meet the financial demands.

In tech updates, Truecaller, a popular caller ID app, has introduced a new AI feature for Android premium users. This feature, dubbed "Max," uses AI to block calls from non-approved contacts or suspected spam, even if they're not in Truecaller's database. This update is not available on iOS due to Apple's restrictions but represents a significant step towards reducing user effort in managing spam calls.

Google researchers have unveiled VLOGGER, an AI system that can generate highly realistic videos from a single photograph. This technology has the potential to revolutionize content creation and virtual interaction, but it also raises concerns about the creation of convincing deepfakes and the spread of misinformation.

Finally, Clicks, a health and wellness retailer, has opened its first in-house e-commerce fulfillment center in Cape Town. This move is part of Clicks' strategy to boost its online shopping capabilities. The warehouse is powered by renewable energy and is expected to save approximately 500 tonnes of carbon emissions per year, demonstrating Clicks' commitment to environmental sustainability.

And that wraps up today's news. Thank you for joining me, Erika, on Just a Moment News. Stay informed and see you next time.
