### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for today, October 21, 2023.

First up, we have Ladysmith Black Mambazo bringing their SA Legacy Tour to Cape Town. After a four-year break, the renowned group will be performing at the Artscape Opera House on November 17 and 18. They will be sharing the stage with artists from their Mambazo Mobile Academy, which focuses on nurturing young talent in isicathamiya and indigenous music. The SA Legacy Tour aims to not only showcase world-class performances but also inspire young artists to preserve culture and heritage through music.

Next, we have Mama Joy Chauke, South Africa's prominent rugby superfan, sharing her experience supporting the Springboks at the Rugby World Cup in France. Despite facing criticism, Mama Joy remains committed to her role and represents all of South Africa. She reveals the deep-rooted rituals and emotions tied to her support, which stem from her childhood in Limpopo. Mama Joy plans to continue her journey, undeterred by critics, and is optimistic about the Springboks' chances in the upcoming match.

In sports news, the All Blacks have secured their spot in the Rugby World Cup final after a dominant victory over Argentina. They defeated the Pumas 44-6, scoring seven tries in the first half alone. New Zealand showcased their strength in both defense and attack, leaving their opponents struggling to keep up. With over a week to rest, the All Blacks are well-prepared to face either England or South Africa in the final, positioning themselves as strong contenders for a fourth world cup title.

Moving on, the Old City Hall subway station in New York City has become a highly sought-after tour destination. Although operational from 1904 to 1945, the station's exclusive access is limited to New York Transit Museum members, with tickets selling out within minutes. The station is known for its architectural beauty, including arched tile ceilings, skylights, and chandeliers. Despite its practical drawbacks, such as a short, curved platform, the station's charm continues to attract visitors. Even tour guides acknowledge the difficulty in securing a tour spot, comparing it to winning a lottery.

In a momentous occasion known as "Super Saffaday," South Africa is set to face England in both international cricket and rugby on the same day. This rare event, which last happened 25 years ago, carries high stakes for both teams. While they compete for a spot in the 2023 Rugby World Cup final, they also aim to recover in their cricket World Cup group stage after unexpected losses. Messages of support and unity have poured in from leading figures, emphasizing the role of sports in transcending competition and serving as a unifying force for South Africa.

Lastly, we have Netflix's series "Bodies," a time-traveling police drama that captivates its audience by exploring four different time periods connected by a mysterious body. Despite its complex narrative, the show maintains interest through strong performances and production values. It delves into social issues like prejudice and xenophobia, while keeping viewers invested through compelling characters and a mystery that unfolds over time.

That's it for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
