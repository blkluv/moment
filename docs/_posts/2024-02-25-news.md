### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika with 'Just a Moment News,' bringing you the top stories for today, February 25, 2024.

Starting off in Johannesburg, the city's power utility, City Power, has taken a strong stance against non-payment of electricity bills. They recently disconnected power at a Damelin campus in Braamfontein due to an unpaid bill nearing R3 million. This is part of City Power's weekly cut-off operation, aimed at recouping revenue owed to the City of Johannesburg. It's worth noting that this isn't the first time a Damelin campus has faced such action; last year, another campus faced a similar situation due to an unpaid bill of R2 million. City Power has made it clear that they will not tolerate non-payment, and this recent action sends a strong message to defaulting customers.

Next up, some interesting news from the world of cryptocurrency. An email from 2009, penned by the enigmatic inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has resurfaced. In this email, Nakamoto predicted the current debate over Bitcoin's energy use. He acknowledged that cryptocurrency mining would be energy-intensive but argued it would still be less wasteful than the conventional banking system. This email has come to light as part of a legal battle over Nakamoto's identity, with developer Craig Wright claiming to be the mysterious figure.

In tech news, a startup called Figure AI Inc., which aims to create autonomous humanoid workers, has attracted some big-name investors. Among them are Jeff Bezos and Microsoft Corporation, contributing to a funding round of about $675 million. The company's goal is to address labor shortages with AI-powered robots capable of thinking, learning, and interacting safely with humans. These robots would be assigned to hazardous warehouse jobs, filling in where there's a shortage of human workers.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., Bitcoin miners have won a legal bid to withhold their energy data. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order, halting the Department of Energy's attempt to collect detailed energy usage data from 82 Bitcoin mining companies. This is seen as a significant win for the cryptocurrency sector amidst ongoing debates over the environmental impact of crypto mining. The outcome could potentially influence future regulations and the integration of cryptocurrency mining with U.S. energy and climate objectives.

In scientific news, researchers in Canada have discovered fossils of a 350-million-year-old tree species, Sanfordiacaulis densifolia. The tree, with its unique structure, is believed to have intertwined its branches with neighboring trees for support. This discovery not only provides insight into plant evolution but also challenges previous understandings of plant life complexity during the Early Carboniferous period.

In entertainment, the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards saw Universal's "Oppenheimer" dominate, winning the best cast in a film award, alongside both lead and supporting actor categories. HBO's "Succession" and "The Last of Us" were also recognized for their ensemble and leading actor performances in drama series, while "The Bear" and "Beef" garnered accolades in comedy categories.

Lastly, in business news, Reddit has announced plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. However, the company's investor pitch conspicuously omits the mention of Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, highlighting a rift between the co-founders that led to their separation in 2020. Despite this, Reddit's transition towards a public offering signals a focus on steering the company towards profitability and expanding revenue sources beyond advertising.

That's all for today's edition of 'Just a Moment News.' I'm Erika, and I'll be back with more news tomorrow. Stay informed and have a great day!
