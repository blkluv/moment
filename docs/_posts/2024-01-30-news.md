### Transcript

Hello, this is Erika, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, where we bring you the top stories of the day. It's January 30, 2024, and we have quite an array of news to discuss, so let's dive right in.

First up, Reed Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix, has made headlines with his generous donation of $1.1 billion in Netflix shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. This charity is well-known among tech founders for its tax benefits and privacy. It's a significant move, considering this donation makes up about 40% of Hastings' direct ownership in Netflix. Hastings, who is well-known for his philanthropy in education and contributions to historically Black colleges, made this donation through a donor-advised fund at SVCF. This method allows donors to recommend how assets are used for charity while receiving immediate tax benefits and maintaining privacy.

Moving on to South Africa, where there's been a notable decrease in the demand for software development jobs. This trend is quite surprising given the previously high demand for IT skills in the country. However, certain IT roles like Systems and Network Administrators have seen a consistent increase in demand. Despite the overall decline, the IT and software development fields still offer numerous job opportunities. Interestingly, the building and construction sector has experienced significant growth in labor demand, particularly for roles like building project managers and electricians.

In tech news, Elon Musk's Neuralink has successfully implanted its first brain chip in a human. This is a significant step in the company's technological advancements. The implantation is part of a trial approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The initial results show promising neuron spike detection. Neuralink has been working towards creating a human-ready product for the past two years, with the aim of aiding individuals with neurological conditions.

Podcast fans might be interested to know that SmartLess is leaving Amazon for a whopping $100 million. SiriusXM has inked a multiyear deal with SmartLess Media for exclusive rights around the flagship podcast hosted by Will Arnett, Jason Bateman, and Sean Hayes, as well as a number of other SmartLess shows. SiriusXM members will have early, ad-free access to SmartLess, as well as three other podcasts that are part of the SmartLess Media podcast network.

In political news, South Africaâ€™s ANC has suspended its former president, Jacob Zuma. This move comes due to his public criticisms of the party and his support for the newly-formed Umkhonto we Sizwe party. The ANC is preparing for a critical election and is concerned about losing support, especially in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma's home base and the ANC's largest provincial supporter.

Heading over to Japan, where the moon lander, Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM), is back on track after a challenging week due to a power supply issue. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency successfully re-established contact with SLIM on Sunday night. This is a significant turnaround in the mission and a testament to Japan's perseverance in space exploration.

Finally, for all you Taylor Swift fans out there, the pop star faces a challenging journey from Tokyo to Las Vegas to attend the Super Bowl, following her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team, the Kansas City Chiefs. Swift's tour schedule in Tokyo ends on Feb. 10, necessitating a quick transition to Las Vegas. While the 17-hour time difference is in her favor, factors like weather and crowded airports during Super Bowl weekend could pose challenges.

And that's all for today's 'Just a Moment News'. This has been Erika, bringing you the most important headlines of the day. Stay informed and I'll catch you in the next episode of 'Just a Moment News'.
