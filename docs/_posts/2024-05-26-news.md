Hello, and welcome to "Just a Moment News." I'm your host, Erika, and today is May 26, 2024. Let's delve into some of today's intriguing headlines.

First up, over in the world of sports, Manchester United clinched their 13th FA Cup victory in a stunning match against Manchester City. The final score was 2-1, with teenagers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo putting the goals on the board for United in the first half. Despite a strong comeback attempt in the second half, including a late goal from City's Jeremy Doku, Manchester City could not secure the win. This victory not only brings United their first FA Cup in eight years but also raises questions about the future of their coach, Erik ten Hag.

Moving to political promises in South Africa, Julius Maleala, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, made significant commitments at a rally in Polokwane. With the elections approaching, Malema promised substantial increases in social grants, including raising the pension to over four thousand Rand and the child support grant to one thousand two hundred Rand. He also pledged to tackle issues such as corruption, land redistribution, and the water crisis, among others.

In tech news, there's a concerning development involving WhatsApp and potential privacy vulnerabilities. A recent report has highlighted a significant flaw in WhatsAppâ€™s encryption system that might allow traffic analysis by government agencies, potentially compromising user privacy. This revelation has sparked internal debates within Meta, WhatsApp's parent company, about balancing functionality with user security.

Over in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's welfare initiatives are making waves. The BJP has been emphasizing the benefits received from Modi's programs, such as free grain distributions and welfare schemes that reach approximately 821 million people. This strategy, combined with the use of technology and data management, has helped Modi maintain a strong base of support, particularly among rural and poorer voters.

In the realm of technology and environment, a startup called WeatherXM is looking to revolutionize weather forecasting using blockchain technology. By deploying a network of 5,000 weather stations worldwide and compensating volunteers with a crypto token, they aim to enhance the accuracy and accessibility of weather data, which could be crucial for responding to climate emergencies.

Lastly, let's talk about the ongoing debate over ultra-processed foods. Despite growing evidence of their health risks, including links to obesity and diabetes, the food industry has been resistant to regulation. This resistance is reminiscent of tactics previously seen in the tobacco industry, with companies emphasizing personal choice and challenging the negative health claims associated with these products.

And in entertainment, the Memorial Day box office is seeing a historic low, with "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga" and "The Garfield Movie" contending for the worst No. 1 opening in forty years. Both films are expected to open with earnings significantly below expectations, reflecting broader challenges in the film industry.

That's all for today's news roundup on "Just a Moment News." Thank you for tuning in. I'm Erika, wishing you a well-informed day. Remember, stay curious and keep discussing. See you next time!
