### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika and welcome to 'Just a Moment News' podcast for the 31st of March, 2024. Let's dive straight into today's news.

Starting with some sporting news, Cambridge University has once again proven its dominance in the annual Boat Races against Oxford. Both the men's and women's teams came out victorious, with the men's team securing their fifth win in six years and the women extending their winning streak to seven consecutive victories. This achievement was shadowed by concerns of E.coli contamination in the Thames, a situation that hit home for the Oxford men's team, as several members fell ill from the virus on the day of the race. Despite these health issues, the Oxford team showed great sportsmanship, refusing to use it as an excuse for their defeat.

In rugby news, the Stormers had a tough first half in their United Rugby Championship clash against Ulster. Coach John Dobson admitted to being "stumped" due to Ulster's dominance. But the Stormers showed resilience, overturning a 7-0 deficit with 13 unanswered points in the second half to secure a 13-7 victory. Dobson praised Ulster's performance and expressed frustration over missed opportunities, but he was pleased with the Stormers' ability to secure "ugly" wins.

Moving on to education news, AdvTech, a leading South African private education group, plans to expand its tertiary qualification offerings into the healthcare sector, specifically targeting nursing. This move is motivated by the current shortage of nurses in South Africa and the high demand for such qualifications abroad, notably in countries like Australia and the UK. They are currently engaging with corporations to establish a healthcare faculty and are exploring partnerships with cruise liners to provide skills training.

In the e-commerce sector, Temu's entrance into the South African online shopping market is making waves due to its competitive pricing strategy. Temu consistently offers lower prices than both Shein and Takealot across a range of products. However, consumers should consider shipping costs, which add to the total purchase price. While Temu offers competitive pricing, the overall value proposition for consumers should consider shipping costs and payment security.

Tech CEOs are increasingly leveraging platforms like Lex Fridman's podcast to communicate directly with their audience. This approach allows them to control their narratives more effectively and avoid potentially adversarial media interactions. However, this trend raises questions about the depth and critical nature of the discourse, as these platforms often lack follow-up on critical questions.

In climate news, researchers at MIT have developed a tool that projects the number of "outdoor days" regions around the world can expect if carbon emissions continue to rise unchecked through 2100. This tool's projections vary significantly by region, with some areas anticipated to gain outdoor days, while others face substantial losses due to increased temperatures. The situation could improve if significant reductions in carbon emissions are achieved by 2070.

Finally, in entertainment news, "Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" has captivated audiences, setting a new record with ten million dollars from Thursday night previews. The film is expected to reach or exceed seventy-five million dollars over the weekend, considerably exceeding initial forecasts. The film received an A- CinemaScore from opening night audiences and garnered a mix of critical responses.

And that's all for today's news. I'm Erika, and this has been 'Just a Moment News'. Thank you for tuning in, and I'll see you next time.
