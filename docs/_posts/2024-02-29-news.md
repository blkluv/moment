Hello everyone, this is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this leap day, February 29, 2024. Let's dive into today's news stories.

Our first story is a sad one. Richard Lewis, the celebrated stand-up comedian and actor, best known for his role on HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm," has passed away at the age of 76. He died of a heart attack at his home in Los Angeles. Lewis had publicly disclosed his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease in the preceding year, leading him to retire from stand-up comedy. However, his love for the craft saw him returning for an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" Season 11, despite health challenges. His career was marked by his unique style of neurotic and self-deprecating humor and his openness about his personal battles with addiction and mental health. His passing has left a void in the industry, but his legacy of humor will continue to endure.

In the world of sports, Christian Horner, the CEO and team principal of Red Bull Racing, has been cleared of allegations of inappropriate behavior following an investigation by Red Bull GmbH. The investigation was launched after a complaint was lodged against Horner, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Despite the ongoing investigation, Horner remained active within the team, participating in pre-season testing and the car launch. Red Bull has concluded that Horner's actions were not inappropriate, effectively closing the case. Horner has been leading Red Bull Racing since its inception in 2005 and has overseen significant successes for the team.

Turning to business news, Woolworth's Food division has seen a significant increase in online sales, largely due to the expansion of its Woolies Dash on-demand delivery service. This surge in digital commerce contributed to the division's overall sales in South Africa. However, Woolworths reported a decrease in half-year earnings across the group due to reduced discretionary spending amidst South Africa's ongoing energy and logistics crises.

In the realm of technology, the recent fiasco of a disastrous Willy Wonka pop-up experience in Glasgow has highlighted the growing concern over the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advertising. The event was promoted with AI-generated images promising a professional, immersive experience, but it turned out to be a poorly executed affair. This situation has sparked a debate on the ethical use of AI in creating promotional materials and the potential for AI to spread misinformation and deceive consumers.

In Cape Town, the City's SmartCape Digital Inclusion Training has made significant strides towards digital empowerment. The program offers training in essential digital skills and has evolved significantly since its inception in July 2002. With future plans to introduce coding, robotics, and other digital literacy components, the City of Cape Town is setting a precedent in municipal-level digital inclusion strategies.

A fascinating discovery was made at Elizabeth Castle on the Island of Jersey. A note invoking the iconic imagery of James Bond was found stashed within a wall during renovations. The note, dated 26 February 1966, has ignited a flurry of speculation and intrigue among local historians and enthusiasts of Jersey Heritage.

In sports memorabilia news, a sealed case of unopened Canadian hockey trading cards was sold for a staggering $3.7 million. The case's value is significantly influenced by its potential contents, notably up to thirty Wayne Gretzky rookie cards from 1979. The sale underscores the enduring fascination with sports memorabilia and the speculative nature of collecting unopened card boxes.

Finally, in gaming news, EA Sports has announced a worldwide launch date for F1 24 on 31 May. The upcoming title promises significant enhancements, including a revamped career mode and the new EA Sports Dynamic Handling System. Prior to the official release, players who pre-order can access time trial challenges in F1 23 with 2024 liveries for Alpine, Haas, McLaren, and Williams before this weekend's season opener.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika, and you've been listening to 'Just a Moment News.' Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow.
