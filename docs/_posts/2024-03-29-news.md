Hello, everyone. This is Erika, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, where we bring you the day's top stories on this 29th day of March, 2024.

First up, the Kansas City Chiefs are making waves in the NFL by signing Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit. Head Coach Andy Reid is known for his innovative strategies, and this move is no different. As part of the NFL’s International Player Pathway program, Rees-Zammit will be tested in multiple football positions, leveraging his rugby skills to adapt to the NFL's new kickoff rules. The young athlete has already turned heads with his speed, and this move underscores NFL's commitment to diversifying its talent pool and connecting with a global audience.

Moving to South Africa, former President Jacob Zuma has been barred from running in the upcoming general election. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) made this decision, possibly linked to Zuma’s 2021 conviction for contempt of court. Despite his disqualification, Zuma's political influence remains critical, particularly with the newly established uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party, which could challenge the ruling ANC. This decision signifies the evolving dynamics of South African democracy, where legal, political, and electoral considerations converge.

In the world of cybersecurity, the MGM Resorts fell victim to a massive hack initiated by a deceptive phone call. The group behind the hack, known as Star Fraud, managed to infiltrate MGM's systems and attempted to exfiltrate over thirty million dollars. Despite the significant losses, MGM refused to pay the ransom and instead rebuilt their security infrastructure from scratch. This incident serves as a critical reminder of the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.

In tech news, Meta is set to update its Ray-Ban smart glasses with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. This upgrade will enable users to interact with the glasses using voice commands, offering a hands-free experience. Despite some limitations in early tests, these glasses represent a significant step towards integrating AI into everyday life.

Over in South Africa, the controversial e-tolls system in Gauteng is officially shutting down. The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) announced that tolling will cease on 11 April 2024. This decision marks a victory for the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), which has long opposed the system. However, the government's stance on historical e-toll debts contradicts earlier promises, indicating plans to pursue outstanding payments.

In the world of cryptocurrency, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the bankrupt firm FTX, has been sentenced to twenty-five years in prison for defrauding customers and investors. His sentencing concludes a saga that has brought intense scrutiny to the cryptocurrency industry and spurred discussions about the need for stricter regulatory oversight.

Finally, New York City is welcoming autonomous vehicle (AV) testing on its roads, but with a catch – a human safety driver must be present at all times. This move aims to proactively manage the integration of AV technology into the city's complex urban environment. Despite New York's strict regulatory environment, the city's status as a major taxi market presents a lucrative opportunity for robotaxi companies.

And that's all for today's news. This has been Erika with 'Just a Moment News'. Thank you for tuning in, and we'll catch you again tomorrow with more top stories.
