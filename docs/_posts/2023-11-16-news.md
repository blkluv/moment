Hello and welcome to Just a Moment News! I'm Erika, and today is November 16, 2023. Let's dive into today's news stories.

First up, there's a major revelation about corruption allegations involving Andr√© de Ruyter, the former CEO of Eskom. During a recent hearing by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), it was revealed that De Ruyter's investigation reports, which aimed to expose corruption at Eskom, never reached the South African Police Service. Instead, fragments of unvalidated information were passed on to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation. This contradicts De Ruyter's claims of providing comprehensive intelligence to the police. In addition, De Ruyter's allegations of corruption involving senior politicians remain unverified, as he refused to identify those involved due to personal safety concerns.

Moving on to sports news, India's Virat Kohli and Mohammed Shami shined in the Cricket World Cup semifinal against New Zealand. Kohli scored his 50th hundred, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's record, while Shami took seven wickets. Their performances helped India secure a 70-run victory and a spot in the final. New Zealand's effort was commendable, but they fell short of the challenging target. The final will take place in Ahmedabad, following the second semifinal between Australia and South Africa.

In the entertainment world, Apple TV+ has released a new series called "Monarch: Legacy of Monsters." The show focuses on human drama rather than the iconic Titans like Godzilla and Kong. Set in 2015, it explores the aftermath of the Godzilla-MUTOs battle in San Francisco and follows a schoolteacher named Cate as she uncovers her late father's secrets. The series features Kurt and Wyatt Russell, adding depth to the narrative. While the portrayal of the Titans adjusts to the television format, the show aims to balance entertainment and substance.

Shifting gears to technology, Showmax, a streaming platform owned by MultiChoice Group, is gearing up for a relaunch in February 2024. The platform will introduce three new plans, including Showmax Premier League, a standalone Premier League mobile streaming service in Africa. Showmax Entertainment and Showmax Entertainment Mobile will offer a broad range of content from major studios. The relaunch will also bring a new look and app for Showmax, utilizing the Peacock streaming technology platform.

In other news, MultiChoice Group has reported a decline in subscribers, influenced by load shedding and the aftermath of the previous year's soccer World Cup. However, the DStv Premium segment experienced growth. The overall subscriber base decreased, but the Rest of Africa segment saw a slight increase. The company's revenue grew organically, but on a reported basis, it was slightly lower. Despite the challenges, the group remains focused on cost savings and improving its core earnings.

Next, we have a story about the City of Cape Town's efforts to ensure mapping platforms like Apple Maps and Google Maps avoid suggesting routes through crime hotspots. The initiative follows a successful discussion with Google, which led to Google Maps avoiding hotspots like Nyanga. However, Apple has yet to respond to the City's request for a similar arrangement. This move comes in response to a recent crime surge, and the city is taking a data-led approach to identify unsafe areas and implement rerouting strategies.

Lastly, the upcoming Las Vegas Grand Prix in Formula One has gained attention not only for the race but also for the inclusion of The Sphere, the world's largest spherical structure. The Sphere features an external LED screen called the "exosphere" and will be used for displaying race-related content and brand activations during the F1 event. The Sphere has faced environmental concerns and traffic issues but is expected to be a major attraction during the F1 week.

That's all for today's news stories. Thanks for tuning in to Just a Moment News! I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
