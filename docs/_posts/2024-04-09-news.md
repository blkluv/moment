Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the top stories of today, April 9, 2024. 

First up, let's talk about the power situation in South Africa. The country has been enjoying a break from its persistent load shedding issues, recording almost two weeks without planned power cuts. This is the longest stretch in 2024 and follows a 19-day period without load shedding over the festive season at the end of 2023. Energy experts attribute this break to a decrease in unplanned breakdowns within Eskom's coal fleet and a reduction in the energy demand placed on the utility. Despite this, energy specialists anticipate that load shedding will persist, particularly during the winter months, due to higher energy demands. 

Moving on to Johannesburg, the city is facing criticism for increasing spending on VIP bodyguards and luxury cars for top officials despite a significant budget cut. The city has allocated extensive security resources to its executive mayor, speaker, and other high-ranking officials, surpassing the protection provided to previous mayors and other cities' mayors. This move has sparked outrage among opposition parties and civil society, who view it as an unwarranted extravagance.

In international news, New Zealand has significantly revised its visa regulations to address what it deems as "unsustainable net migration." The changes include the introduction of English language proficiency standards, the establishment of a minimum skill criterion, and the reduction of the maximum continuous tenure for Accredited Employer Worker Visa holders to three years. This move is designed to mitigate the risks of unemployment for New Zealanders by more rigorously testing the local labor market. 

In the world of science, researchers have been studying the phenomenon of "kamikaze bacteria," where certain bacteria engage in self-destructive behavior by releasing toxins to benefit their conspecifics. This research has significant implications for understanding bacterial infections and developing new medical treatments.

In the entertainment industry, WrestleMania 40 marked a significant turning point for WWE under the new ownership of Endeavor. The event saw the integration of augmented reality (AR) and innovative camera work, enhancing the viewer experience. This shift is not just about adopting new gadgets for the sake of novelty but about enhancing storytelling and viewer immersion. 

Actress Natalie Dormer, known for her roles in Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games, has been exploring the local culture and natural beauty of South Africa while filming the crime thriller, White Lies. Despite her packed filming schedule, she managed to go on a safari and visit various beautiful locations within Cape Town.

Lastly, in automotive news, BYD Company Limited, a leading Chinese automotive manufacturer, has filed two trademark applications in South Africa for the "BYD Shark," an electric and hybrid bakkie, and the "BYD King," a plug-in hybrid sedan. The launch of these models underscores BYD's ambition to widen its presence in the electric vehicle sector globally.

And that's all for today's 'Just a Moment News'. This is Erika, signing off. Stay informed, stay safe, and have a great day!
