Good morning, everyone! I'm Erika, and you're listening to "Just a Moment News" on November 20, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research laboratory, has appointed a new interim CEO. Emmett Shear, co-founder of Twitch, will be taking the helm. This comes after the unexpected departure of former CEO Sam Altman, who was ousted due to alleged lack of candor. OpenAI's board has gone through some significant changes recently, with the resignation of President Greg Brockman and the exit of several senior researchers. Despite these developments, OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft remains strong.

Moving on to sports, let's talk about the 2023 Heineken Las Vegas Grand Prix Race. Max Verstappen, initially critical of the event's focus on entertainment, had a change of heart after winning his 18th race of the season. Verstappen celebrated his victory on the Las Vegas Strip, complete with a Bellagio fountain show and fireworks display. The race faced some criticisms for overshadowing racing with entertainment, but overall, it was considered a success, with exciting competition and a track layout that provided thrilling racing moments.

In other news, the Durban port in South Africa is experiencing severe congestion, with approximately 71,000 containers stuck at sea. Equipment breakdowns have caused delays, impacting businesses and leading to congestion surcharges for South African imports. Efforts are being made to stabilize operations and clear the backlog, including short-term interventions and long-term plans for equipment upgrades and expansion.

Shifting gears to cricket, Australia has clinched its sixth Cricket World Cup title with a six-wicket win over India. Travis Head played a pivotal role, scoring 137 off 120 balls, leading Australia to victory. The team showed remarkable resilience throughout the tournament, rebounding from initial losses and implementing a strategic shift in their batting approach. India, previously unbeaten in the tournament, set a total of 240, but Australia's bowling limited their score. The final saw standout performances from Head and Marnus Labuschagne, with Australia achieving the target with over six overs to spare.

Now, let's talk about streaming records. During the ICC Cricket World Cup final in India, Hotstar reached a record 59 million concurrent viewers, surpassing its previous record. This strengthens Hotstar's position in the streaming market, despite challenges faced by its parent company, Disney, in India. Disney has lost subscribers and is evaluating the future of its local business, but remains interested in maintaining a presence in the country.

Lastly, the world's best kitesurfers are heading to Cape Town for the Red Bull King of the Air 2023 competition. This event, known for its extreme aerial displays, will feature riders from around the world. The competition takes place from November 25 to December 14 and draws thousands of spectators to Cape Town's Kite Beach. The athletes will showcase their skills and tricks, judged on their highest-scoring maneuvers.

That's all for today's news. I'm Erika, and you've been listening to "Just a Moment News." Have a great day!
