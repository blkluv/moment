### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika from the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, bringing you the top stories for today, March 4, 2024. 

First up, we have an exciting update from the world of space exploration. NASA's SpaceX Crew-8 mission, part of the Commercial Crew Program, was set for launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This mission marks the eighth crew rotation mission to the International Space Station and the ninth human spaceflight under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The Crew-8 mission involves the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon spacecraft, named Endeavour, which has previously supported multiple NASA missions. The crew consists of NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin. This mission is significant for several reasons, including the successful partnership between NASA and commercial entities like SpaceX, paving the way for future human space exploration missions.

Moving on to South Africa, Richards Bay, a major industrial hub, is facing a severe crisis fueled by sabotage, extortion, and targeted murders linked to transport mafias and labor disputes. The city, home to Africa's biggest deepwater port and numerous industrial giants, has seen a dramatic increase in heavy-duty truck traffic. The local government and businesses are under immense pressure, facing demands from worker forums acting as labor brokers and extorting businesses. Despite these challenges, there's a concerted effort by the local government and businesses to address the issues.

In another story from South Africa, Chris Campbell, a British national, sought information on the renewal of retirement visas for himself and his wife, Irene, through the South African Department of Home Affairs. The situation escalated when an official allegedly demanded a bribe of sixty thousand Rand to expedite the visa process. Despite initial investigations, the Hawks, a special investigating unit, reported that the "alleged official" was not recognized by the department, and the investigation remains ongoing.

In political news, the Democratic Alliance plans to supply the Public Protector with further details regarding Police Minister Bheki Cele's trip to the Rugby World Cup in Paris, following additional information acquired through a Promotion of Access to Information Act application. Taxpayers were billed significant amounts for the assistant's expenses. This situation has led to the Public Protector initiating an investigation into Cele's trip, amidst accusations by the DA of misuse of public funds and violation of the Executive Members' Ethics Act and Executive Ethics Code.

On the sports front, the 192nd Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium underscored the current disparity between Manchester City and Manchester United, with City clinching a 3-1 victory. City's dominance was evident through their ball control and offensive pressure, while United's reliance on a defensive strategy and the impact of injuries on their lineup underscored their current limitations.

In the realm of technology, Pelonomi Moiloa, CEO and co-founder of Lelapa AI, emphasizes the significance of developing artificial intelligence tools for local languages in South Africa. Moiloa highlights the importance of having language models that grasp the local context, pointing out that foreign-developed models often lack this understanding and can inadvertently propagate harmful perspectives.

Finally, in real estate news, Harry Macklowe, a notable New York City developer, has placed his Hamptons property on the market for thirty-eight million dollars despite it being uninhabitable. The mansion lacks a certificate of occupancy, making it illegal for new owners to inhabit. This situation arises from Macklowe's unauthorized environmental modifications to the property, including land clearance and construction without permits.

And that wraps up our news for today, March 4, 2024. This is Erika from the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, signing off. Stay informed and have a great day!
