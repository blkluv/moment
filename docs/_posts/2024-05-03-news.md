### Transcript

Hello everyone, welcome to "Just a Moment News." I'm your host, Erika, and today is May 3, 2024. We have a variety of interesting news stories to discuss, so let's dive right in.

Starting off with some news from the financial sector, South Africa is currently reviewing proposed new regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. The Financial Intelligence Centre has introduced these rules to align with the Financial Action Task Force's "Travel Rule," which mandates the sharing of information about the originators and beneficiaries of financial transactions to combat crime. Crypto exchanges and service providers are required to gather extensive personal data for both local and international transactions, which has stirred a mix of concern and approval within the industry. The main issues revolve around the practicality of implementing these rules, potential risks to data privacy, and the implications for the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. Feedback from industry stakeholders is being collected until the end of May, and it will be interesting to see how this develops.

In tech news, Apple has recently released its earnings report for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2024. It appears there's been a noticeable drop in iPhone and iPad sales, with iPhone revenue down by 10 percent. However, it's not all gloomy for Apple, as their services sector has seen a significant increase, which has helped offset the decline in hardware sales. Despite these challenges, Apple remains confident, authorizing a substantial $110 billion for share repurchases.

Moving on to a groundbreaking development in medical science, researchers have made a significant breakthrough in creating universal donor blood. By using enzymes from a specific gut bacterium, they've managed to convert blood types A, B, and AB into type O, which can be universally accepted in transfusions. This could potentially revolutionize how blood shortages are managed globally, although further research and patient trials are needed to ensure its safety and efficacy.

In real estate news, Aston Martin has made a grand entrance into the residential market with the opening of a 66-story luxury tower in Miami. This marks the British carmaker's first venture into real estate, featuring high-end amenities and nearly all units sold prior to completion. It's a bold move that showcases the growing trend of luxury branded residences.

In sports, Tiger Woods has accepted a special exemption to play in this year's U.S. Open, despite his current low ranking. This decision highlights his significant contributions to the sport and adds an exciting element to the upcoming tournament.

Lastly, in the world of soccer, the Philadelphia Union has made a notable move by signing 14-year-old Cavan Sullivan to a record-setting homegrown contract. What makes this deal particularly interesting is the inclusion of a pre-arranged transfer clause that will see him move to Manchester City when he turns 18. This strategy not only secures significant financial benefits for the Union but also underscores their commitment to nurturing homegrown talent.

And in entertainment, Jerry Seinfeld's directorial debut, "Unfrosted," is creating a buzz with its nostalgic and humorous take on the backstory of Pop-Tarts. The film promises to be a delightful mix of humor and historical whimsy, focusing on the rivalry and innovation in the cereal industry during the '60s.

That wraps up today's episode of "Just a Moment News." I'm Erika, and I hope you found these discussions insightful. Join us again next time for more updates and stories. Have a wonderful day!
