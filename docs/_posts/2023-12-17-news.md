### Transcript

Hello, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' and today is December 17, 2023. Let's jump right into today's stories.

First up, we have some exciting news from the world of UFC. At the last pay-per-view event of the year, UFC 296, Leon Edwards successfully defended his welterweight title for the second time with a dominant win over Colby Covington. Despite some pre-fight trash talk from Covington, he was unable to match Edwards' energy in the Octagon. Edwards, who is unbeaten in 13 straight fights dating back to 2015, now holds the second-longest winning streak in welterweight history. In the co-main event, Alexandre Pantoja also successfully defended his UFC flyweight title with a unanimous decision win over Brandon Royval.

In other news, Nestlé has announced the discontinuation of Nesquik in South Africa, due to low consumer demand. This decision is influenced by the high cost of milk and concerns over the high sugar content of Nesquik. With the global trend showing a decrease in cow milk consumption and increasing awareness about sugar intake, consumer preferences have shifted away from sugary drinks. Despite the discontinuation, Nestlé will continue producing Milo, Hot Chocolate, and Cocoa.

Now, onto the rugby field. The DHL Stormers recently secured a narrow victory over La Rochelle in the Investec Champions Cup. This win is significant as it highlights the strength of South African teams against European rugby giants. Despite trailing for most of the game, the Stormers managed to secure victory in injury time, a testament to their resilience and skill.

In political news, Jacob Zuma, the former president of South Africa, announced he will vote for Umkhonto WeSizwe, a new political party, rather than the African National Congress in the next elections. Despite his decision, Zuma remains an ANC member and has expressed his disapproval of the current leadership under President Cyril Ramaphosa.

In the world of entertainment, Warner Bros.' "Wonka" has had a strong opening weekend, heading towards a $37M-$38M box office collection. The film, which didn't initially market itself as a musical, is particularly popular among young female audiences. Other films like Lionsgate's "Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes" and MGM's "American Fiction" are also making an impact.

Lastly, in film reviews, "Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire," directed by Zack Snyder, has received mixed reviews. With a substantial budget of $165 million, the movie aims to weave a complex narrative but is criticized for its derivative plot and underdeveloped characters. Despite its elaborate world-building and sci-fi tropes, "Rebel Moon" has struggled to fully engage its audience.

And that wraps up our news for today. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', wishing you a great day ahead.
