Hello, this is Erika with Just a Moment News, bringing you the top stories on this 24th day of March, 2024.

First up, the Financial Times is testing a new AI chatbot called 'Ask FT'. This AI is unique as it's been trained on decades of the outlet's own articles. The bot is exclusive to paid subscribers and is designed to cater to business professionals and institutions, answering queries on a wide range of topics. However, it's not without its flaws, with testing revealing inconsistencies such as outdated information. But despite these issues, the initiative represents a significant step in the evolution of information dissemination, blending traditional journalism's credibility with cutting-edge AI technology.

In sports news, Ferrari's Carlos Sainz clinched victory at the Australian Grand Prix, interrupting Red Bull's dominant start to the Formula 1 season after Max Verstappen was forced to retire due to car failure. This marked Sainz's third Grand Prix victory, a remarkable feat considering he had undergone appendicitis surgery just two weeks prior. The race was also notable for Ferrari's overall performance, securing a one-two finish, a feat not achieved since Bahrain 2022.

Meanwhile, in international football, Austria's Christoph Baumgartner set a new record for the fastest goal, scoring six seconds into a friendly match against Slovakia. This historic event took place in the Tehelne Pole stadium in Bratislava, leaving Slovak supporters astonished and Austrian fans ecstatic. Baumgartner's record surpassed the previous fastest goal set by Lukas Podolski of Germany in 2013.

In the world of ultrarunning, Jasmin Paris, a 40-year-old from Scotland, made history by becoming the first woman to complete the notoriously grueling Barkley Marathons. Paris's achievement places her among only 20 individuals who have completed the race since its extension to 100 miles in 1989. Her success is a landmark moment in the history of ultrarunning, demonstrating the extraordinary capabilities and resilience of athletes who dare to challenge the Barkley Marathons.

In figure skating, 40-year-old Deanna Stellato-Dudek and her partner Maxime Deschamps made history by winning the World Figure Skating Championship, making Stellato-Dudek the oldest woman to achieve this feat. Despite retiring in 2001 due to injuries, Stellato-Dudek made a remarkable comeback to the sport, transitioning from singles to pairs skating in her 30s. She aims to inspire others to pursue their goals, regardless of age.

In the music industry, Swedish composer Johan RÃ¶hr has emerged as Sweden's most-streamed artist on Spotify, surpassing well-known acts like Britney Spears and Abba. His extensive catalog, consisting of more than 2,700 songs, has accumulated over 15 billion plays, securing his position among Spotify's top 100 most-streamed artists globally.

In a wild story from Cape Town, a couple armed only with pillows and books managed to fend off a hungry leopard that climbed into their rooftop tent while camping in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Despite the traumatic experience, the couple remains undeterred from their love of camping in the wilderness.

Finally, the Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to an estimated eight hundred million dollars after no tickets matched all six numbers in the recent draw. This growing jackpot follows a streak of thirty-five drawings without a winner. The upcoming Monday drawing offers the winner a choice between annuitized payments or a lump sum of approximately three hundred and eighty-four point eight million dollars.

That wraps up our news for today. This has been Erika with Just a Moment News, bringing you the stories that matter. Stay informed and have a great day!
