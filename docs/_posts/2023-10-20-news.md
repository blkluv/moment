Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for today, October 20, 2023. Let's dive right into the stories.

First up, SA Rugby has raised concerns over a death threat made against Springbok scrumhalf Cobus Reinach. Reinach, who plays club rugby in France for Montpellier, received threats on social media after South Africa's victory over France in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals. SA Rugby director Rassie Erasmus shared screenshots of the threats on social media. In response, SA Rugby CEO Rian Oberholzer said they will be escalating the issue to authorities and assured that all players have security measures in place. Reinach is the first player reported to receive threats during this Rugby World Cup. The Boks and England will meet this Saturday in the semi-final in Paris.

Moving on, Bill Burr's Netflix film "Old Dads" is a straightforward comedy targeting an older male demographic. The movie, co-starring Bobby Cannavale and Bokeem Woodbine, revolves around three middle-aged friends navigating a "woke" society after losing their jobs to a younger disruptor. While the humor and character dynamics are well-executed, the plot elements are predictable. The film is expected to resonate with fans of Bill Burr's comedy style and is now available for streaming on Netflix.

In other news, Jon Stewart's Apple TV+ show, "The Problem," has been canceled after two seasons. Reports suggest that Apple executives were uncomfortable with Stewart's planned discussions around artificial intelligence and China. Although the show received critical acclaim for its political commentary, Apple wanted Stewart and his team to align more with the company's views. Rather than compromising the show's editorial independence, Stewart chose to end the partnership with Apple TV+.

Shifting gears to sports, England has announced their starting XV for their Rugby World Cup semifinal match against South Africa. The team has recalled fullback Freddie Steward, loosehead prop Joe Marler, and lock George Martin to strengthen their scrum against the powerful South African forwards. Captain Owen Farrell will start at flyhalf as England seeks revenge for their defeat against South Africa in the 2019 World Cup final. The winner of this match will advance to face either New Zealand or Argentina in the final.

Next, a couple claimed to have captured footage of Bigfoot while hiking in Colorado. The sighting drew skepticism from Bigfoot expert Michael Rugg, who noted that the creature could potentially be a person in a suit seeking publicity. Public reactions to the claim have been mixed, with believers and skeptics questioning the authenticity of the footage. Bigfoot sightings have a long history in American folklore, primarily reported in the Pacific Northwest since the 1800s.

Lastly, UFC 294 is set to take place this Saturday at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi. The main event features a rematch between UFC lightweight champion Islam Makhachev and featherweight champ Alexander Volkanovski. Makhachev, ranked No. 2 in ESPN's pound-for-pound rankings, will defend his title against Volkanovski, who took the fight on short notice. In the co-main event, former welterweight champion Kamaru Usman moves up to middleweight to face Khamzat Chimaev in a No. 1 contender fight for a shot at the 185-pound champion Sean Strickland.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
