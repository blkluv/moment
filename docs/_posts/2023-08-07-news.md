Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is August 7th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have some exciting news from the film industry. The Warner Bros. film "Barbie," directed by Greta Gerwig, has made history by surpassing $1 billion in global box office sales in just 17 days after its release. This incredible achievement not only sets a new record but also marks the fastest ticket sales in Warner Bros.' 100-year history. The success of "Barbie" challenges previous records set by films directed by women and highlights the potential of films with strong female leads to attract significant attention and revenue.

Moving on to sports, South African swimmer Jessica Thompson has won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Young Games in Trinidad & Tobago. Thompson broke the Commonwealth Youth Games record twice in a day, first in the morning heats and then again in the finals. She expressed her excitement and pride for her country and also shared her aspiration to compete in the upcoming Junior Worlds in Israel and qualify for the Paris Olympics next year. Team SA also participated in beach volleyball, men's rugby sevens, and triathlon on the same day.

In netball, the Australian Diamonds emerged victorious in the 2023 Netball World Cup final, defeating the England Roses with a score of 61-45. This win secured Australia's 12th World Cup title and marked the first time in 28 years that the tournament wasn't contested between Australia and New Zealand. England finished in their best position since 1975, claiming a silver medal. Kiera Austin from Australia was named the Player of the Final, while England's Helen Housby was named the overall MVP and best shooter of the tournament.

Now, let's talk about an intriguing search operation taking place at Loch Ness. The Loch Ness Centre and volunteer group Loch Ness Exploration are teaming up for a significant search operation aimed at finding the mythical Loch Ness Monster. With the help of state-of-the-art equipment such as thermal drones, infrared cameras, and a hydrophone, they hope to uncover any evidence of the creature's existence. Amateur "monster hunters" and tourists are also invited to participate in the search and document potential sightings. Despite the apparent absurdity of the mission, the groups remain resolute in their quest, driven by a fairly convincing sighting a couple of years ago.

Shifting our focus to the political realm, there is mounting pressure on correctional services commissioner Makgothi Thobakgale to send former South African president Jacob Zuma back to prison. This comes after the Supreme Court of Appeals' decision last year that Zuma must complete his 15-month sentence for contempt of court. Despite calls for mercy due to Zuma's age and health, the author asserts that Thobakgale must treat Zuma like any other prisoner, reinforcing the rule of law. The author also criticizes Zuma's litigation against a journalist and a prosecutor, deeming it malicious and meant to intimidate the media and prosecutors. The argument for pardoning Zuma to avoid political instability is rejected as it sets a dangerous precedent of impunity and undermines the constitution.

Lastly, we have an ongoing taxi strike in the Western Cape. Talks between the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) and the Western Cape Government (WCG) have failed, resulting in the strike's continuation until August 9th. Santaco is demanding the return of impounded taxis without fines, a dedicated traffic lane, and a hold on Operating Licences conditions. On the other hand, the WCG proposed solutions to alleviate the impact of impoundments on operators while working towards resolving operating license issues. Golden Arrow Bus Services has obtained a court interdict against Santaco members' intimidation and harassment. The strike has caused violence, deaths, and significant disruption to public transportation, raising concerns among citizens about its impact on their livelihoods.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
