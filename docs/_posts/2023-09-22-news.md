Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the headlines for today, September 22, 2023. Let's dive into the stories:

First up, Apple fans in South Africa can now pre-order the new iPhone 15, with deliveries starting on September 29. The new iPhone features a new chipset for enhanced gaming and USB-C inclusion across all models. The cheaper models also now have the Dynamic Island feature. Pricing starts at R22,000 for the base model, with the iPhone 15 Plus starting at R25,000 for a larger 6.7-inch display. There are various color options available, and customers can take advantage of trade-in schemes and freebies when purchasing through select retailers.

In other news, a wealthy businessman from KwaZulu-Natal, Nkululeko Mkhize, was killed in a police shootout at Zimbali Estate. Mkhize was suspected of being involved in the shooting of five individuals in Richards Bay. Police recovered firearms and ammunition from the scene. The incident has raised concerns about the estate's security measures and the presence of criminals on the property. An investigation is currently underway.

Moving on, Cape Town is taking another step towards sustainable energy with a new solar wheeling project. The Brackengate 2 Business Park will house a 5.5MW rooftop solar installation that will redirect electricity to the national grid and save carbon emissions. The project, which is in line with the city's climate change and sustainability objectives, is expected to be implemented in 2024.

In the world of media, media mogul Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as chairman of the board of Fox and News Corp. His oldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will take over as sole chair of both companies. Rupert Murdoch will become Chairman Emeritus of each company. This move marks a significant transition for the 92-year-old media tycoon, who built an empire from a string of local papers in Australia.

Lastly, Pizza Hut's Australian division recently experienced a data breach, exposing customer data, including pizza order histories and preferences like pineapple toppings. The company claims to have secured its systems and is conducting a forensic investigation. This is not the first cybersecurity issue for Pizza Hut, as its UK and US operations also faced ransomware attacks earlier this year.

And that's all for today's headlines. Stay informed and have a great day ahead! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
