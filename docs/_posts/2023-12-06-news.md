### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! I'm Erika, and this is Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for today, December 6, 2023. Let's get started.

Our first story takes us to India, where the country is building its largest renewable energy project in the salt deserts. The Khavda renewable energy park, located in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch, is set to become the world's largest renewable energy project. This solar and wind energy project will cover an area of 726 square kilometers and is estimated to be completed within three years at a cost of $2.26 billion. Once operational, it will generate 30 gigawatts annually, powering nearly 18 million homes. This project is a significant step towards India's commitment to 500 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070. However, there are concerns about its environmental impact, as it is exempt from environmental impact assessments. Critics argue for a more balanced approach, considering local economies and ecosystems.

Moving on to our next story, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has rolled out a new feature that allows users to transfer crypto via links sent on popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. This feature aims to broaden Coinbase's user base and addresses the challenges and costs associated with international bank transfers. Transfers using USD Coin (USDC) are fee-free, and recipients can easily set up a wallet by downloading Coinbase Wallet from the provided link. Coinbase has also introduced a "simple mode" for less tech-savvy users. Despite the increase in its share price this year, Coinbase's stock remains below its 2021 peak.

Next, we have an interesting story about the sleep app Calm. They have announced a new project called "It's a Wonderful Sleep Story," which is based on the classic movie "It's a Wonderful Life." The unique aspect of this project is that it features the AI-generated voice of the late Jimmy Stewart, recreated by a Kyiv-based startup called Respeecher. The project received the consent of Stewart's family and estate before moving forward. While some may find this project intriguing, others see it as a sign of the times, where studios are keen to lock actors into deals that turn their digital likenesses into everlasting revenue streams.

In South Africa, foreign tourists traveling to Sun City and nearby game parks have been targeted by armed highwaymen demanding euros and valuables. These incidents, involving ambushes of tour buses, have raised concerns about tourism safety in the region. Efforts are being made to enhance safety, including the deployment of tourism monitors and the establishment of an emergency response call center. However, these incidents highlight the ongoing challenges in ensuring tourist safety and have a negative impact on tourism in the area.

Shifting gears, let's talk about the best podcasts of 2023. Some notable podcasts include "Criminal," a series about wrongful acts, "Decoder Ring," which explores cultural phenomena, and "Heavyweight," a series that helps people find answers to personal dilemmas. Other podcasts mentioned are "More Perfect," "Say More With Dr? Sheila," "The Sound," "Think Twice: Michael Jackson," "The Turning: Room of Mirrors," and "Weight For It." These podcasts cover a wide range of topics, from true crime to cultural trends and personal stories.

Lastly, we have news from the gaming world. The first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI has broken MrBeast's record for the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It achieved 85 million views in just 22 hours, surpassing the previous record. This milestone indicates the immense anticipation for GTA 6, which is set to be released in 2025. The trailer's release was prompted by a leak on Twitter, leading Rockstar Games to officially release it and remove the leaked version.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off. Have a great day!
