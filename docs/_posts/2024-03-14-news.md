Hello everyone, this is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on the 14th of March, 2024. Let's get started with today's news.

First up, a significant development from Apple. The tech giant has revealed some transformative details about its latest iPhone software update, iOS 17.4, that could change the iPhone experience forever. The changes, which are in response to the European Union's Digital Markets Act, give app developers more control over promotions, discounts, and deals. Interestingly, the most groundbreaking update is yet to come later in the spring, which will allow web distribution of iOS apps directly from developers' websites to EU users. This is a significant shift from the previous requirement that apps be downloaded exclusively from the App Store. These changes seem to be shaking up the app distribution landscape, potentially setting a precedent for regulatory changes in other regions.

In the realm of media, Vivian Reddy, Rob Alexander, and the Oceans Umhlanga have emerged victorious in a Press Council ruling against the "Daily Maverick". The dispute arose over misleading reports, marking the fourth instance of required retractions and apologies to Reddy and associates. The Press Council's decision mandates the correction of misinformation, an apology from the "Daily Maverick," and the provision for Reddy and the Oceans Umhlanga to fully reply. This case highlights the ongoing issues with responsible journalism practices by the publication.

Moving on to the digital art and image editing world, Microsoft Paint, a traditional tool in the Windows suite, has received a significant update. The new features include the introduction of layers, AI-powered features like background removal and transparency support for ".png" files, and the Paint Cocreator which leverages generative AI to produce images from text prompts. These updates reflect Microsoft's strategy to make advanced capabilities more accessible and a broader industry trend of leveraging AI for creative and productivity tasks.

In gaming news, Google's DeepMind has introduced SIMA, an AI model designed to understand and execute natural language commands across various 3D gaming environments. This project represents a move towards more versatile AI agents that could be applied in cooperative gaming contexts, where the AI acts more as an interactive assistant rather than a superhuman competitor.

In the fast-food industry, franchises like KFC, Taco Bell, and Dairy Queen are using AI to track workers. An AI system named Riley, developed by Hoptix, analyzes video and audio data to measure employees' sales tactics and rewards those with higher sales conversions with cash bonuses. However, this growing trend of AI-based surveillance in the fast-food industry raises concerns about worker privacy and the imposition of potentially unrealistic productivity standards.

In the world of sports, the South African Sevens rugby team, the Blitzboks, are getting a coaching makeover. Philip Snyman has been appointed as the new head coach, aiming to improve the team's performance in time to qualify for the Olympic Games. This decision underscores the urgency and importance of turning the team's fortunes around to ensure their participation in the Olympics and maintain their core status in the World Series.

Lastly, the Professional Fighters League (PFL) has entered into a media rights agreement with SuperSport, enhancing the accessibility of mixed martial arts (MMA) in the region. PFL's strategic expansion includes the development of additional international leagues, aiming to become the "Champions League of MMA." This expansion, combined with strategic partnerships and technological advancements, positions PFL for significant growth and increased global influence in the MMA domain.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to 'Just a Moment News'. This is Erika, signing off.
