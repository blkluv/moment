### Transcript

Good day, listeners! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for November 22, 2023. Let's dive into today's stories.

First up, we have a major development in the cryptocurrency world. Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, the brawling boss of Binance, has suffered a sudden defeat. Zhao, who has been a prominent figure in the industry, pleaded guilty to criminal charges including anti-money laundering and violations of U.S. sanctions. This plea came as part of a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, allowing Binance to continue operating. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay over $4 billion in penalties. Zhao resigned as CEO and was fined $50 million. This marks a turning point in the regulatory efforts to control Binance and the crypto industry as a whole.

Moving on, archaeologists in Peru have made an exciting discovery. They have unearthed 1,000-year-old mummies of children in Lima. These children are believed to come from the Ychsma culture that thrived on Peru's central coast before the rise of the Inca Empire. The remains were found at the foot of a staircase on a small hill, which is believed to have once hidden a temple. The discovery provides insights into the ancient culture and their burial practices.

In other news, there are talks underway to bring back Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI. A wide search for new OpenAI board members is taking place, with input from executives in Silicon Valley, including Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. Altman, who was ousted as the company's leader, recently announced his intention to join Microsoft. However, the employees at OpenAI have threatened to quit if Altman is not rehired. The situation remains uncertain, but it highlights the ongoing changes and discussions within the tech industry.

Next, NASA has achieved a groundbreaking milestone in space communication. The Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) successfully transmitted a laser beam encoded with data from the unmanned Psyche spacecraft to Earth. This marked the farthest demonstration of optical communications to date, as the laser traveled 10 million miles to reach Earth. This achievement has significant implications for future manned missions to Mars and deeper space explorations, as it allows for higher data rates and more efficient transmission of information.

Shifting gears, we have some entertainment news. Netflix has shared a first look at Eddie Murphy's return to the Beverly Hills Cop franchise in Beverly Hills Cop 4. The image shows Murphy's character, Axel Foley, facing a pair of cops in a Detroit Lions jacket. The sequel, directed by Mark Molloy, also stars Kevin Bacon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Taylour Paige. The franchise, which follows the adventures of Detroit cop Axel Foley in Beverly Hills, has been a fan favorite since its debut in 1984.

Lastly, we have a proud moment for South Africa. "The Smeds and the Smoos," an animated adaptation of a children's book, has won the International Emmy for Best Kids' Animation. The animation, co-directed by South Africans Daniel Snaddon and Samantha Cutler, has received multiple awards and recognition. It tells a heartwarming story of unity and understanding, resonating with audiences around the world.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off. Have a great day!
