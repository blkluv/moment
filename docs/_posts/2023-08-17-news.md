### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for August 17, 2023. Let's dive into today's stories.

First up, Shoprite has unveiled its new cashless store called OK Urban in Sonstraal, Cape Town. This store represents a sophisticated transformation of a previous corner shop, emphasizing convenience, freshness, quality, and technology. Some key features include a modern and welcoming design, a fresh food and bakery section, an in-store sushi chef and barista, eco-friendly practices, and efficient checkout options. This move reflects Shoprite's strategic entry into the high-end market and showcases their commitment to innovation and sustainability. It's definitely a glimpse into the future of the brand.

Next, we have a concerning story about the rise of voice cloning cybercrime. Cybercriminals are using AI tools to create convincing deep fakes of voice notes, aiming to gain credibility and manipulate individuals and companies. Ransoms have been paid, and transactions have been manipulated as a result. Stephen emphasizes the need for proper governance procedures in organizations and highlights the importance of vigilance and verifying voice notes by calling the perceived sender. The technology's ability to recreate voices, even in multilingual contexts, raises concerns over its misuse. In a world where even a voice note may not be what it seems, caution and skepticism are necessary.

Moving on, Takealot, a South African e-commerce platform, is testing a new 1-hour delivery service called TakealotNow in Cape Town. This service, available through the MR D app, offers fast deliveries until 10pm for selected products, including laptops, smartphones, beauty essentials, toys, and backup power products. Takealot has noticed a consistent rise in sales when faster delivery options are provided, and CEO Frederik Zietsman sees the significance of this trend. Alex WÃ¶rz, Mr D CEO, also highlights the potential for scaling this service across the country using their existing network. The service is expected to expand to the rest of the city in the coming months.

Now, let's talk about the streaming war in South Africa. According to market research and projections from Digital TV Research, the battle for stream TV supremacy is primarily between Netflix, Showmax, and Amazon Prime Video. By 2029, the number of subscription video-on-demand subscribers in Africa is expected to reach 18 million. Netflix is projected to be the biggest video streamer in Africa, followed by Showmax and Amazon Prime Video. However, video streaming penetration is expected to remain low in Africa, with only 7.7% of TV households subscribing to at least one streaming service by 2029. It's an interesting competition to keep an eye on.

Lastly, scientists have made an incredible breakthrough in music research. They have successfully recreated a recognizable version of Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)" by reading the brain signals of listeners. This study, conducted by a research team in Shanghai, used data collected from epilepsy patients with electrodes implanted in their brains. By identifying specific areas in the brain and training computer models, they were able to bring the song into focus. The researchers also discovered a brain area linked to rhythm perception. These findings open doors for building new speech prosthetics for people with neurological diseases, aiming to retain musicality, rhythm, and emotion in speech. Other research groups are also exploring similar experiments with noninvasive brain scanners. It's fascinating to see how the brain processes music and the potential applications of this research.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
