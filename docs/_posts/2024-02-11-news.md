Good day everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' bringing you the latest updates on this 11th day of February, 2024. 

First up, we have some exciting news from the world of rugby. Eddie Jones, the head coach of the Japanese national rugby team, has taken on Victor Matfield, a renowned South African rugby figure, as a consultant. Matfield, who has a pretty impressive track record, having retired in 2015 with 127 test matches under his belt, has since moved to coaching. This new role with the Japanese team is a significant step in his coaching career. Matfield will be involved in strategic planning and analysis, as well as sharing his insights on the evolution of rugby. This partnership could be a game-changer for the Japanese rugby team, leveraging Matfield's extensive experience and knowledge of the game.

In royal news, King Charles has expressed his gratitude for the public's support following his recent cancer diagnosis. This is his first public acknowledgment of his illness since Buckingham Palace announced his condition. The King is currently undergoing treatment and has chosen to work from home at Sandringham, Norfolk, and rest post-treatment. The King's diagnosis has sparked a surge in public interest in cancer symptoms, with a fifty-one percent rise in searches reported by the NHS. This situation is also affecting the schedules of the Prince and Princess of Wales, with the Princess recovering from surgery and the Prince briefly returning to public duties.

Turning to the world of entertainment, Taylor Swift has just arrived in Los Angeles from Japan ahead of Super Bowl 2024. Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, will be competing against the San Francisco 49ers. Swift's arrival follows a significant week for her, having made history at the Grammys by becoming the first artist to win Album of the Year four times. She also announced her upcoming 11th studio album, set for release on April 19.

In scientific news, researchers from Guangxi University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China have found a way to slow down light by 10,000 times. This new method could have significant implications for computing and optical communication. The researchers created a new material, a kind of metasurface, which is much better than existing options in the way it holds and releases energy from light. This breakthrough could lead to better control over how light travels, which is crucial in fields like broadband internet and quantum computing.

In sports, the Sunrisers Eastern Cape have secured their second consecutive SA20 title, overcoming Durbanâ€™s Super Giants by eighty-nine runs at Newlands, Cape Town. The Sunrisers' victory was a result of strategic batting, disciplined bowling, and dynamic fielding. Their bowling attack, led by Marco Jansen, Daniel Worrall, and Ottneil Baartman, was particularly impressive, dismantling the opposition and securing the win.

In other sports news, Las Vegas is set to host Super Bowl LVIII, with the San Francisco 49ers going up against the Kansas City Chiefs. This year's Super Bowl is expected to draw a historic viewership spike, thanks in part to the anticipated presence of high-profile celebrity fans. Both teams are eyeing historical significance with a win, adding to the excitement and anticipation surrounding the event.

Finally, at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, Ronwen Williams played a pivotal role in securing a bronze medal for Bafana Bafana. His exceptional goalkeeping skills were on full display during the penalty shootout against the Democratic Republic of Congo, contributing to South Africa's 6-5 victory. This win marks a resurgence for South African football after a 24-year absence from the Afcon semi-finals.

And that wraps up our news for today. Thank you for joining me, Erika, on 'Just a Moment News'. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow.
