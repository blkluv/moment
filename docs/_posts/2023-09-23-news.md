### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is September 23, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have a big Rugby World Cup showdown between the Springboks and Ireland. Both teams have been performing well in their respective pools, with Ireland leading in points. The winner of this game will secure their place in the quarter-finals. It's worth noting the recent history between these teams, with Ireland on a 15-Test winning streak and the Springboks looking to break their losing streak against Ireland since 2016. The coaches and players from both sides are aware of the challenges they'll face, and it's shaping up to be an intense battle.

Moving on, residents in Durban North are facing a water crisis that has been ongoing for five days. The city's initial communication about the issue was unclear, but community efforts, such as water distribution from mosques and donated tankers, are helping to alleviate the situation. The Democratic Alliance has criticized the mayor for his absence, and there are claims of possible sabotage as the cause of the crisis. The municipality acknowledges the issue and is working on finding solutions, but allegations of sabotage have not been clearly addressed.

Next, we have a controversial event involving South African fossils being sent into space. A Virgin Galactic commercial flight carried two fossils of ancient prehuman relatives, organized by paleontologist Lee Berger and approved by the South African Heritage Resources Agency. However, this has sparked backlash among scientists and researchers. Critics argue that the flight posed a risk to the preservation of these invaluable fossils and goes against the permitting policy. This event has led to calls for a review of permitting policies and discussions around the ethical considerations related to heritage and science.

In entertainment news, Netflix has launched a reality show called "Squid Game: The Challenge," based on its popular original series. The show will feature contestants from around the world competing for a record-breaking cash prize. Inspired by the original series, the reality show aims to bring the fictional world of "Squid Game" into a real-world competition and social experiment, promising fans an unpredictable journey filled with tension and twists.

Turning to the weather, the South African Weather Service is warning of cold, wet, and windy conditions this weekend. A storm system is expected to develop, bringing severe weather including floods, thunderstorms, and strong winds to various regions of the country. Coastal areas may also experience high seas, while high-lying areas could see icy temperatures and light snowfall. A weather advisory is currently in place for the Western and Northern Cape.

Lastly, we have news about a monument in Tshwane that has been completed for five years but remains closed to the public. The Women's Living Heritage Monument, built at a cost of nearly 200 million Rand, has not received an occupancy certificate due to non-compliance with building regulations. The City of Tshwane cites deviations from approved plans and missing engineering certificates as reasons for the delay. The department responsible for the project attributes the delay to vandalism and theft but has not provided a timeline for the monument's opening.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off. Have a great day!
