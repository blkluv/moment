### Transcript

Hello, everyone! This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' bringing you the top stories today, April 20th, 2024.

First up, let's talk about Netflix. The streaming giant has just announced a substantial growth in its first-quarter earnings, adding a whopping 9.3 million subscribers. This boost has solidified its position as the leading platform in subscription streaming television, with its global total now sitting at 269.6 million subscribers. The company also reported strong financials, with revenues hitting an impressive nine billion, four hundred million dollars. As for its future plans, Netflix is looking at further developing its advertising tier and diversifying its entertainment offerings to include live programming and sports. They're also planning to increase their revolving credit facility to three billion dollars, aiming to maintain a robust financial standing while returning excess cash to shareholders.

Next up, we've got a story about some of the most exclusive networking events in the world. These events, like "The Weekend" held at the St. Regis hotel in Aspen, Colorado, are a hot ticket for CEOs, VIPs, and billionaires. Attendees include big names like Elon Musk, Ron Howard, Karlie Kloss, and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. These gatherings offer a sanctuary where influential leaders can engage in private discussions and leisure activities without the intrusion of public and media scrutiny. They're becoming increasingly popular among the elite, reflecting a growing demand for privacy, exclusivity, and high-quality interactions.

In wildlife news, two White Bengal tigers have been rescued from over two years of captivity in a residential property in Boksburg. They were relocated to the Isindile Big Cat and Predator Sanctuary in Fouriesburg, Free State. This marks a triumph for wildlife protection efforts in South Africa, highlighting the issues with private ownership and breeding of exotic animals for non-conservation purposes.

In sports, China's top long-distance runner, He Jie, recently won a half-marathon in Beijing under suspicious circumstances. He overtook three African runners in the final moments, seemingly aided by them as they slowed down. This incident has stirred controversy and skepticism about the fairness and transparency of competitive sports in China.

On to some adventurous news, three Russian parachutists have achieved a world record by jumping from a height of ten thousand five hundred meters into the North Pole from an Ilyushin-76 aircraft. They also tested a new prototype communication system designed for Arctic use. This mission highlights the growing strategic significance of the Arctic, a region that is becoming a focal point for resource, trade, and military competition among global powers.

In health news, a recent study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine has explored whether intermittent fasting contributes to weight loss due to metabolic changes or simply by reducing caloric intake. The study found that both groups lost an equivalent amount of weight, suggesting that the effectiveness of intermittent fasting might simply stem from reduced calorie consumption rather than any unique metabolic effects.

And finally, in the world of film, "Rebel Moon â€” Part Two: The Scargiver," directed by Zack Snyder, continues the visually distinctive but derivative saga begun in the first film. Despite its length of over four hours when combined with the first installment, the sequel struggles with substance, featuring extended sequences of wheat harvesting and an overuse of slow-motion effects typical of Snyder's style.

And that wraps up our news stories for today. Thank you for tuning in to 'Just a Moment News'. This is Erika, signing off.
