### Transcript

Good day, I'm Erika from Just a Moment News, and here are today's headlines and summaries for December 2, 2023.

First up, the City of Cape Town conducted safety drills at the Koeberg nuclear power plant to test its readiness for potential incidents. Despite the plant's incident-free operation, it's important to be prepared for emergencies. The drills evaluated emergency response protocols and the protection of surrounding communities.

Moving on, the Department of Basic Education in South Africa is expressing concern about the risks associated with matric rage festivals, which mark the end of the 12-year school journey for thousands of students. Strict security measures and dedicated transport services are in place to ensure safety, with police and local security forces enforcing zero tolerance for drunken behavior.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has admitted that the underwhelming box office performance of "The Marvels" can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of COVID-19 on production and Disney's over-reliance on sequels. Despite the financial results, actress Iman Vellani, who starred in the movie, expressed satisfaction with the final product and highlighted its entertaining qualities.

Next, there are concerns about the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT, with users noticing changes in its behavior. While the chatbot still has the ability to perform tasks, some prompts are not yielding the same results. Experimentation with new prompting strategies takes time and resources, which may not be worth it for some users.

In financial news, an Eastern Cape municipality in South Africa is facing criticism for spending nearly R100 million on upgrading a beachfront project. The final project differs from the initial plan, leading to questions about increased costs and delays. Concerns have been raised over corruption, excessive costs, and shoddy construction.

Police Minister Bheki Cele attended the Rugby World Cup in France, with expenses fully funded by a private company. Cele clarified that taxpayers did not cover the costs. The Springboks, South Africa's national rugby team, won the World Cup, and Cele's participation was part of a wider political presence at the tournament.

Lastly, Max Verstappen, the Red Bull Racing driver, has become the highest-paid Formula 1 driver in 2023, earning an estimated $70 million in salary and bonuses. The top 10 F1 drivers collectively earned approximately $258 million. The sport's rising popularity and increased revenue have been attributed to factors such as Netflix's "Drive to Survive" series.

That's all for today's news. I'm Erika from Just a Moment News, and I'll be back with more updates soon.
