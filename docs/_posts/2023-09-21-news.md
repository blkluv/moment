### Transcript

Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is September 21, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have some details on the grisly deaths of Elon Musk's Neuralink monkeys. A recent Wired report contradicts Musk's statement that no monkey has died as a result of a Neuralink implant. Documents obtained by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) reveal multiple instances of monkeys being euthanized due to complications from Neuralink's brain implants. The PCRM has accused Musk of securities fraud and filed a complaint with the USDA, claiming Neuralink violates the Animal Welfare Act. Neuralink is also under investigation by the US Department of Transportation for allegedly transporting contaminated devices. An anonymous former employee disputes Musk's claim that the monkeys used were "close to death," calling it a "straight fabrication."

Next, OpenAI has unveiled DALL-E 3, an upgraded version of its text-to-image tool. DALL-E 3 uses ChatGPT, OpenAI's AI chatbot, to help users generate images based on prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI's premium ChatGPT plans can type in a request for an image and refine it through conversations with the chatbot. DALL-E 3 generates higher-quality images that more accurately reflect prompts, especially with longer prompts. It also has mechanisms to reduce algorithmic bias and improve safety. OpenAI plans to roll out DALL-E 3 to premium ChatGPT users in October.

Moving on to tragic news, two naval mariners have died and two are hospitalized after a rescue operation in Kommetjie, South Africa. During an exercise near Kommetjie, a large wave hit a submarine, causing two men to be washed out to sea. An integrated search and rescue operation involving multiple agencies was launched, resulting in the recovery of two bodies and the airlifting of one male in critical condition. The incident is under investigation by the SA Navy and Western Cape police.

In Austria, a 42-year-old British man has died after falling 300 feet from a ladder bridge in the Dachstein Mountains. The man was alone on the ladder when the accident occurred. The ladder is a popular spot for tourists seeking a good Instagram photo. The climb is listed as a via ferrata, or "iron path," and is rated moderate/difficult. Investigators have ruled out any third-party negligence in the man's fall.

In a positive development, Project Gutenberg has put 5,000 audiobooks online for free using synthetic speech. The open book repository has turned thousands of its titles into audiobooks, making them more accessible to those who prefer that format. The selection of audiobooks is idiosyncratic but demonstrates the power of accessibility in literature. Project Gutenberg teamed up with MIT and Microsoft to use AI-generated speech to bring the books to life. The first batch of audiobooks is available for free on platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and the Internet Archive.

Lastly, we have a review of Apple TV+'s show "The Morning Show" Season 3. The latest season has moments of improvement but retains its flawed characteristics. Set in 2022, the plot revolves around professional and personal complexities at UBA, a media company. The season tackles themes of gender inequality and offers commentary on societal issues such as cancel culture and Roe v. Wade. While the show has its shortcomings, it engages in big conversations and features an attractive cast.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
