Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest stories from around the globe on this 11th day of March, 2024. 

Let's kick things off with a recap of the 96th Oscars, which were quite a spectacle this year. Ryan Gosling's performance of "I'm Just Ken" from the film "Barbie" was a standout moment, despite the film being overlooked in some major categories. The Oscars also served as a platform for social commentary, with many attendees expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza. And who could forget John Cena's nearly naked appearance, a humorous nod to the changing norms of live broadcasts. The event was a blend of entertainment, activism, and a celebration of cinematic achievements.

In tech news, Elon Musk is reportedly gearing up to take on YouTube. He has announced that long-form videos will soon be accessible on smart TVs through a new TV app for Amazon and Samsung users. This is part of Musk's vision of transforming X, formerly Twitter, into a "super-app" that competes with established video content platforms. Despite some challenges, this move represents Musk's broader strategy to diversify X's content offerings and revenue streams.

Moving on to the British monarchy, a poorly edited image of Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, has sparked widespread speculation and criticism. The image, which was released following Middleton's prolonged absence due to an undisclosed abdominal procedure, has been seen as an inept attempt to reassure the public. This incident has brought the monarchy's image management strategies under scrutiny and has fueled discussions about their intentions.

In South Africa, grocery retailer Shoprite has decided against transitioning its Checkers Sixty60 delivery fleet to electric vehicles for now. The decision comes after a trial that deemed electric vehicles currently not viable. This contrasts with competitors like Uber and Spar, who have initiated moves towards electrification in their delivery services.

In the world of sports, Sean O'Malley emerged victorious over Marlon "Chito" Vera in the UFC 299 main event. O'Malley's dominant performance showcased his technical prowess, securing him a unanimous decision win. Post-match, he expressed interest in exploring new challenges, including a potential move up in weight class.

Meanwhile, in Formula 1, 18-year-old British driver Oliver Bearman made a striking debut at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Despite the pressure and intensity of his first Formula 1 race, Bearman maintained his composure and performed impressively, earning praise from fellow competitors.

In the field of medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) has made a significant contribution to nephrology. A study from the University of Texas at Dallas unveiled a novel kidney cell renewal mechanism, which could enhance kidney transplantation and treatment. AI's role in refining the donor-recipient matching process and its potential to increase the number of transplantable organs is truly groundbreaking.

Lastly, a team of 21 scientists embarked on an exploration mission to the Bounty Trough near New Zealand's South Island, resulting in the discovery of around 100 new marine species. These findings underscore the importance of exploring under-researched aquatic areas for better management and conservation of marine life amidst ongoing environmental challenges.

That wraps up our news for today, March 11, 2024. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', wishing you a pleasant day ahead. Stay informed and stay safe!
