### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the top stories for today, April 11, 2024.

We begin with a leap in medical science. Moderna's mRNA cancer vaccine, initially developed for melanoma, is showing potential for treating head and neck cancer. This technology, which gained recognition through its application in COVID-19 vaccines, is now being used in research targeting various cancers. Early trials have shown increased survival rates when used with immunotherapy. The technology is also being explored for treating rare disorders like propionic acidaemia, which could lead to a new class of drugs capable of treating a wide range of conditions. This breakthrough in medical science is being called the "golden age of vaccines", but the journey ahead is complex with growing vaccine hesitancy.

In business news, KPMG's Dutch division is facing a record $25 million fine over an ethics scandal involving widespread cheating on professional exams by its staff, including senior partners and managers. The firm's former audit leader, Marc Hogeboom, has been fined $150,000 and banned for life from working with firms auditing US public companies. This incident is the latest in a series of ethical breaches within the Big Four accounting firms, pointing to a persistent problem of cheating on internal exams.

On the tech front, Apple has issued alerts to iPhone users in ninety-two countries about potential mercenary spyware attacks. These notifications underscore the seriousness of the threat, indicating that the targeting is likely due to the users' identities or their activities. This move by Apple highlights the increasing concern over state-sponsored and mercenary cyber activities, especially in a time crowded with global electoral processes.

In the world of green energy, Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder, and Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, are backing SunCulture, a Nairobi-based start-up specializing in solar irrigation for small-scale farmers across Africa. The company's innovative solution involves supplying small solar-powered water pumps that are partially subsidized by carbon credit sales. This initiative enables farmers to transition from diesel-powered pumps, enhancing agricultural productivity in regions previously challenged by insufficient irrigation.

Switching gears to sports, the recent behavior of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, including violent conduct during a match and other unsporting actions, is raising questions about maintaining professionalism and dignity amidst the pressures and temptations of high-profile sports careers. This behavior not only tarnishes his legacy but also serves as a cautionary tale about the challenges athletes face in adapting to changing roles and expectations.

In motorsports, Formula 1 is set for significant technical rule changes in 2026, aimed at enhancing safety and maintaining the sport's relevance. However, early simulations have revealed challenges, with cars becoming "undriveable" at times due to the changes. In response, the FIA is focusing on reducing aerodynamic downforce to facilitate closer racing and improve the spectacle for fans.

Finally, in entertainment news, the Fallout TV series is excelling in capturing the essence of the video game's world. Set against the backdrop of a post-nuclear California, the narrative weaves through the lives of characters like Ella Purnell's Lucy, on a quest to find her kidnapped father. The series shines in its portrayal of the absurdity and brutality of this postapocalyptic world, balancing dark humor with the grotesque.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', reminding you to stay informed and engaged. Have a great day!
