Hello everyone, this is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this beautiful day of January 25, 2024. Let's dive into the top stories making headlines around the world today.

First up, we have some concerning news regarding the role of artificial intelligence in elections. The Attorney General of New Hampshire is currently investigating robocalls that used AI to mimic President Joe Biden's voice to dissuade voters from participating in the state's primary election. This incident highlights the increasing influence of AI in elections and the difficulties tech companies and AI firms face in combating disinformation campaigns. While nearly 30 states in the U.S. are planning to regulate deepfakes in elections, the current regulations are fragmented and limited. Tech companies are also struggling to manage election misinformation, with platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook coming under scrutiny. The misuse of AI in politics is not just a domestic issue, with instances in Taiwan and India where AI-manipulated content is being used to question the truth, complicating the work of fact-checkers and analysts.

Switching gears to the world of sports, let's talk about the Africa Cup of Nations. South Africa and Tunisia played to a 0-0 draw, a result that allowed South Africa to advance to the last 16 while eliminating Tunisia. The game was marked by a cautious approach from both sides, particularly in a congested midfield. South Africa's defensive strategy paid off, despite a lack of significant offensive action. Tunisia's performance was less than stellar, deviating from their coach Jalel Kadri's pre-match promises of intelligence and intensity. South Africa now faces the challenge of improving their play in the knockout stages.

In entertainment news, Netflix has decided to scrap the release of “The Mothership,” a science-fiction film starring Halle Berry. The movie, which finished filming in 2021, couldn't be completed after multiple delays in post-production. This comes as a blow to fans who were eagerly awaiting the film's release. However, Berry fans need not despair as she will continue to work with Netflix on the action film “The Union.”

In a surprising turn of events, Comedy Central is bringing back Jon Stewart, its most celebrated host, for the 2024 election cycle. Starting February 12, Stewart will host Monday nights, with various correspondents covering other weekdays. Comedy Central hopes Stewart's return will help cultivate new talent and find a successor.

Moving on to a tragic incident in the Western Cape, Rico Pentz, founder of Helderberg Wildlife Rescue and Anti Animal Cruelty, passed away following a snouted cobra bite. Despite receiving eight doses of antivenom, Pentz's body showed no response to the treatment, a reaction doctors found unprecedented. His dedication to rescuing animals of all species will be remembered.

Now, let's talk about a groundbreaking development in Africa. The Paarl Africa Underground Laboratory (PAUL), a pioneering initiative in the Western Cape of South Africa, marks Africa's entry into the realm of deep underground scientific research. This facility, a decade in planning, aims to be a global center for physics research, especially in studying dark matter.

Finally, in tennis news, Alexander Zverev defeated Carlos Alcaraz in a thrilling match at the Australian Open, advancing to the semi-finals against Daniil Medvedev. In the women's competition, Ukrainian qualifier Dayana Yastremska continued her remarkable journey, defeating Linda Noskova. She will face Chinese 12th seed Zheng Qinwen, who overcame Anna Kalinskaya.

That's all for today's 'Just a Moment News.' Thank you for tuning in, and I hope you found these updates informative. This is Erika, signing off. Stay informed and have a great day!
