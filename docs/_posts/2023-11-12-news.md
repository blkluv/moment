Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you today's headlines on November 12, 2023. Let's dive right in.

In the world of UFC, two titles were up for grabs at UFC 295. Alex Pereira shocked the crowd by defeating Jirí Procházka and claiming the UFC light heavyweight title. Pereira's counter left and right hooks proved to be the game-changer, sending Procházka to the ground. Meanwhile, Tom Aspinall emerged victorious in the co-main event, winning the interim belt at heavyweight. This marks England's third-ever UFC champion and first in the heavyweight division. Pereira's achievement also puts him in the company of Amanda Nunes as the only Brazilian fighters to win belts in two divisions.

Moving on to a disturbing crime story, Samuel Haskell IV, the son of a prominent Hollywood agent, was arrested for murder after his wife's dismembered torso was found in a dumpster. Haskell allegedly tried to hire day laborers to remove bags containing the body parts from his home, misleading them by claiming the bags contained rocks. However, the workers became suspicious and returned the bags to Haskell's driveway before attempting to report the incident to the police. The investigation revealed substantial evidence of a murder in Haskell's home. Thankfully, the couple's three children were safe at school and are now under the care of Child Services.

Shifting our focus to South Africa, the South African Air Force is facing allegations of excessive catering costs on its VIP aircraft, Inkwazi. A recent report revealed that catering costs for a canceled flight to Turkey amounted to nearly 91 thousand rand, with none of the food returned. Additionally, VIPs often request to be dropped off at OR Tambo International Airport to avoid traffic, further depleting the budget. These excessive costs are a waste of taxpayer money, especially considering the financial difficulties the South African Air Force is already facing, with 85% of its aircraft being unserviceable due to financial shortages. Taxpayers are urged to demand immediate action to address these issues and hold VIPs accountable for their role in wasting public money.

In an exciting archaeological discovery, recent genetic analysis of a mummified baboon from ancient Egypt suggests that the fabled land of Punt may have been near modern-day Eritrea. The analysis of the baboon's DNA aligns with species found in the Red Sea coastal areas, indicating that the port city of Adulis in the Aksumite Empire could have been Punt. This finding opens up new avenues for research into ancient Egyptian maritime technology and the impact of human trade on wildlife diversity. It also sheds light on the cultural significance of baboons in ancient Egypt. The study continues to unravel the mysteries surrounding ancient Egyptian civilization and its connections to Punt.

Now, let's talk about a film review. David Fincher's "The Killer," available for streaming on Netflix, brings to life Alexis Nolent and Luc Jacamon's graphic novel. The film stars Michael Fassbender as an emotionless assassin on a personal vendetta. Fassbender's performance showcases cold precision and a lack of empathy, but the script's excessive telling over showing weakens the impact. While the movie's action sequences highlight Fincher's meticulous style, the film falls short in terms of emotional depth. The structure, split into chapters and vignettes, focuses on the killer's assignments and competence, but fails to delve deeply into his psyche. Overall, "The Killer" receives a grade of C+.

In the world of entertainment, there has been outrage over the cancellation of John Cena's Looney Tunes movie, "Coyote vs. Acme." Despite high test scores and a substantial budget, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation decided not to promote the completed film, opting for a refocus on theatrical releases. This decision is part of a broader strategy under CEO David Zaslav. The film's director and composer expressed disappointment over the cancellation, citing the project's quality and audience reception.

Lastly, an Elon Musk biopic is in the works at A24, with acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky set to helm the project. The biopic will be based on Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of the controversial tech mogul. Aronofsky's surreal filmmaking style, known for psychological elements, makes him an intriguing choice for this project. The adaptation of Isaacson's "Steve Jobs" book into the 2015 film starring Michael Fassbender received critical acclaim. Musk himself expressed support for Aronofsky's involvement, praising the director's talent.

That wraps up today's news stories. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
