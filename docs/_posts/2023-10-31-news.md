### Transcript

Good morning and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is October 31, 2023. Let's get started with today's headlines.

First up, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation in a 30-minute national speech. He highlighted the government's achievements, including the Springboks' World Cup win. Ramaphosa declared December 15 as a public holiday for celebration and discussed efforts to mitigate load shedding and reduce unemployment. He also emphasized the importance of unity and resilience in the country.

In tech news, Apple has launched new MacBook Pro and iMac models powered by their new M3 family of chips. These chips promise high performance and energy efficiency, continuing Apple's trend of using custom, ARM-based silicon. The new computers also feature secure screen-sharing and cater to professionals in various fields. Apple's shake-up has led to a reaction from Qualcomm and Nvidia, who are exploring ARM-based chips for Windows machines.

Meta Platforms Inc., the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is launching subscription-based, ad-free access to these platforms in several European countries. Priced at €9.99/month on the web and €12.99/month on mobile, this move is in response to European regulations on data collection and usage. Meta still supports ad-based services and will continue to offer them alongside the subscription model.

Openserve, a major fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) provider, is upgrading its line speeds for free between November and December 2023. Afrihost, a reseller of Openserve's services, has confirmed the speed increases for its customers. However, there is uncertainty regarding pricing and timing from other service providers, indicating that terms may vary depending on the internet service provider (ISP).

In entertainment news, MultiChoice ran a promotion offering a discounted streaming package for the 2023 Rugby World Cup Final. However, users encountered billing issues due to the 30-day cancellation policy, resulting in outstanding balances on their accounts. MultiChoice has yet to comment on the matter.

Lastly, the Springbok rugby team, after winning the World Cup, is scheduled to undertake a four-day trophy tour across South Africa. The tour will include stops in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Soweto, Cape Town, Durban, and the Eastern Cape. To encourage fan participation, the Gautrain Management Agency announced free-of-charge travel for those wearing Springbok or South African colors on the day of the team's arrival at OR Tambo International Airport.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
