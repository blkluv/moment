Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 14, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, residents of Johannesburg are dealing with the aftermath of a destructive hailstorm that hit the city and surrounding areas. The storm caused severe damage to vehicles and structures, including carports. Thankfully, there were no reported fatalities, but one person did sustain minor injuries in Soweto. The Joburg Emergency Management Services have issued a warning to parents and guardians to monitor children and avoid playing near flooded rivers and streams.

In the world of car auctions, a 1962 Ferrari GTO race car has fetched a record-breaking $51.7 million. The car, previously owned by Jim Jaeger, was sold by RM Sotheby's. While the final sale price was lower than expected, the Ferrari GTO still takes the top spot as the most expensive car sold this year.

Next, we turn to Famous Brands' acquisition of Lexi's Healthy Eatery, a plant-based dining chain. Despite the initial trend towards healthier eating, the closure of Lexi's original store in Sandton, along with challenges post-pandemic, led to the decision to shut down all Lexi's restaurants. However, Famous Brands plans to rebrand Lexi's into a quick-service restaurant format, targeting health-focused consumers.

In a move to enhance tourist safety, Google Maps will now avoid routing drivers through Cape Town townships following recent attacks on motorists. Google has identified crime hotspots and is adjusting its navigation recommendations accordingly. The collaborative agreement between Tourism Minister Patricia de Lille and Google South Africa's country director, Prof Alistair Mokoena, aims to promote South Africa as a safe tourist destination.

Moving on, we have an episode of TCS, hosted by Duncan McLoud of Tech Central, featuring Tom Chittum, Senior Vice President for Forensic Services at Sound Thinking. Chittum discusses ShotSpotter, a technology used to combat gun crime in Cape Town. ShotSpotter uses acoustic sensors to detect and locate gunfire, providing real-time alerts to police. The system has been deployed in various cities globally and has had a positive impact on public safety.

In other news, the CEO of the Tourism Business Council of South Africa, Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa, has denied claims that Trevor Noah was paid 33 million rand for a South African tourism advertisement. Tshivhengwa confirmed that Noah received a smaller fee, emphasizing the value of using Noah's global appeal to promote South African tourism.

Lastly, Doritos, owned by PepsiCo, has developed AI technology called "Doritos Silent" to address the distracting crunch sound made by their chips during gaming sessions. The technology, available for free download, uses AI to detect and mute the crunch sound of Doritos. This innovation aims to allow gamers to enjoy Doritos without the disruptive noise.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
