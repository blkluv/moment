### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News'. Today is January 13, 2024, and we have a lot to cover. Let's dive right in.

First up, we have a high-stakes legal battle unfolding in the art world. Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev is suing Sotheby's, accusing the auction house of assisting Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier in defrauding him in high-value art transactions. At the heart of this dispute is the claim that Bouvier, who was once Rybolovlev's trusted art advisor, secretly inflated prices, including the price of Leonardo da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi". This trial is not just about the staggering $232.5 million in damages sought by Rybolovlev, but it also exposes the intricate dynamics within the elite art market.

Moving on to the world of science and technology, Colossal Biosciences is making headlines with their ambitious goal to revive extinct species like the woolly mammoth. The company is attracting investors and making strides in this pioneering field. Not only are they planning to bring back species like the Tasmanian tiger and the dodo, but they are also exploring various revenue-generating models in these areas. The company's CEO, Ben Lamm, has detailed their progress, particularly on the mammoth project, which aims to produce the first mammoth calves by 2028.

Next, we have a milestone for the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway in Cape Town, which just welcomed its 31 millionth visitor. The lucky guest was Gerda Pretorius, a tourist from Bloemfontein, marking her first return to Table Mountain in over 30 years. The cableway, which has been a prominent feature in Cape Town since 1929, is known for its panoramic city views and is a popular attraction for both locals and tourists.

In sports news, Cricket South Africa has relieved David Teeger of his captaincy of the SA under-19 cricket team ahead of the World Cup, citing security risks due to his comments supporting the Israel Defence Force. Despite an inquiry concluding that Teeger hadn't breached CSA's code of conduct, the decision was made with the safety and interests of all participants in mind. Teeger will remain a squad member, and a new captain will be announced soon.

On the telecommunications front, Lyca Mobile, the world's largest mobile virtual network operator, has ceased its operations in South Africa. Despite initially viewing South Africa as a market with significant growth potential, the company cited unspecified challenges that led to its exit. This contrasts with the overall growing trend in the country's MVNO market, with research predicting that virtual mobile operators in South Africa will double their market share within the next 2-3 years.

Finally, in the world of entertainment, we have a review of "Lift," a Netflix heist film directed by F. Gary Gray. The film stars Kevin Hart as Cyrus, who leads a crew of tech geniuses and masters of disguise in Venice. Despite attempts at excitement and complexity, the film reportedly struggles to fully engage the audience.

And that's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me, Erika, on 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed and see you next time!
