Hello everyone, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News'. I'm your host, Erika, and today is April 12, 2024. Let's dive into today's news stories.

First up, the passing of O.J. Simpson at the age of 76 due to cancer has been announced. Simpson's life was a rollercoaster of highs and lows, with his early achievements in football and celebrity status being overshadowed by his infamous 1994 arrest and trial. Accused of the murder of his ex-wife and her friend, the trial was highly publicized and resulted in his acquittal, sparking a nationwide debate over racial biases in the American justice system. His later years were marked by a downfall in his public image, a lost wrongful-death suit, and a prison sentence for robbery and kidnapping. His life remained a focal point of public interest and controversy until his death.

In business news, WeBuyCars, a used car business under Transaction Capital, has made its debut on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with shares opening at twenty Rand per share. This successful listing and the capital raised prior to it marks a significant growth for the company from a family-owned entity to a dominant player in South Africa's pre-owned vehicle market. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is also looking forward to a boost from ten expected listings this year, including a cannabis firm and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.

In sports, Erik van Rooyen has led the South African players in the first round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club. He has placed seventeenth, six shots behind the leader, Bryson DeChambeau of the United States. The tournament experienced delays due to rain, pushing the completion of the first round to the following day.

The Weather Company, known for operating The Weather Channel, has unveiled a novel generative AI tool named ReelSphere, aimed at revolutionizing weather reporting on television. This tool is designed to enhance video weather reports by automatically incorporating captions, graphics, and hyperlocal weather data overlays, including an AI-generated voice that mimics a local meteorologist.

In South Africa, a report has shown that nine users of fibre-to-the-home services from three major ISPs consumed over 1.6 petabytes of data in the first quarter of 2024. The highest data usage was recorded by a Level-7 customer with a 500/250 Mbps Openserve connection, who used 411.4 terabytes, equivalent to over ten thousand two-hour 4K movies.

In archaeological news, a study has revealed the origins of silver used in coinage around 660 CE in northwest Europe. The study utilized advanced techniques to trace the origins of the silver in 49 medieval coins, demonstrating a transition in the silver source from the Byzantine Empire to mines in Melle, Aquitaine.

Lastly, a new discovery at the archaeological site of Pompeii has unveiled a banqueting hall adorned with black-painted walls and frescoes depicting mythological scenes from the Trojan War. The ongoing excavations continue to reveal significant historical insights into daily and ceremonial life in Pompeii before it was buried under volcanic ash from Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E.

That wraps up our news for today, April 12, 2024. I'm Erika, and this has been 'Just a Moment News'. Thank you for listening, and we'll catch you next time.
