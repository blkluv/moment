### Transcript

Good day, listeners! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for November 8, 2023. Let's dive into today's stories.

First up, in the world of cricket, Glenn Maxwell's outstanding performance led Australia to victory in the CWC 2023 match against Afghanistan. Maxwell scored an unbeaten double century, securing Australia's spot in the World Cup semifinals. Despite a challenging start, Maxwell's partnership with Cummins turned the game around, with Australia successfully chasing down the target of 292. This victory places Australia alongside India and South Africa in the semifinals.

Moving on to the world of streaming services, SABC+ has revealed its subscriber numbers. The streaming service, which was acquired by SABC, now has 600,000 users. Initially starting with 135,000 subscribers, SABC+ offers SABC's TV and radio channels, as well as catch-up content. While it fell short of its projected 915,000 subscribers, SABC+ has been recognized as the fastest-growing OTT platform in South Africa. The recent 2023 Rugby World Cup significantly boosted registrations, despite some technical issues during high-demand matches.

In movie news, "The Legend of Zelda" is set to receive a live-action adaptation directed by Wes Ball. Co-produced by Nintendo and Sony Pictures, the film will be financed primarily by Nintendo, with Sony handling global distribution. This project follows a previous unsuccessful attempt by Netflix to adapt the popular video game franchise. With development underway, the challenge lies in adapting the traditionally silent protagonist, Link. Nintendo is deeply involved in the project, expressing long-term involvement and excitement.

Switching gears to a concerning trend in South Africa, there has been an increase in banking app kidnappings. Criminal syndicates are targeting individuals, forcing them to make banking app transactions, often internationally. This poses challenges for law enforcement, as security measures like PINs and biometric authentication are rendered useless. Bank Zero suggests keeping minimal funds in transactional accounts and the rest in notice accounts to deter such crimes. However, this may not be feasible for individuals with complex banking needs. Prevention, education, and personal safety remain key in addressing this issue.

In technology news, the traffic navigation app Waze is introducing a new feature called crash history alerts. By utilizing historical data, road, and traffic data, Waze aims to warn drivers about dangerous areas prone to accidents. Originally an independent startup, Waze was acquired by Google in 2013 and has since been integrated into Google Maps. While the app has faced some challenges in the past, such as routing cars through quiet neighborhoods, it remains a popular choice for its advanced traffic rerouting capabilities.

Lastly, Uber is celebrating its 10-year anniversary in South Africa by launching an electric bike delivery service called Uber Package. Starting in Cape Town, the service will expand to Johannesburg in 2024. Two scooter models will be available, offering different speeds and battery ranges. In addition to Uber Package, Uber is introducing various services such as Uber One, Uber Direct, Uber Live, Uber Reserve, Uber Van, and Uber Black, catering to different transportation and delivery needs.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
