### Transcript

Hello, everyone! This is Erika, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast. Today is April 10, 2024, and we have some interesting news stories to discuss.

Our first story comes from South Africa. Deputy President Paul Mashatile has made a public commitment to end load shedding in the country by the end of this year, a significant promise considering the impact of load shedding on the nation's economy and daily life. This isn't just a pre-election promise, but a post-election strategy to address the country's energy crisis sustainably. In addition to this, Mashatile has also highlighted the importance of the upcoming general election and the participation of independent candidates. He has also addressed another critical infrastructure challenge—water scarcity—and revealed plans for immediate action through a special task team.

Moving on, let's talk about South Africa's wind energy sector. Despite having over thirty-four private onshore wind projects operational, the country has yet to install a single offshore wind turbine. This situation is attributed to the abundance of onshore wind resources and the absence of a clear government policy framework for offshore wind energy. However, studies suggest that offshore wind farms, if developed, could significantly exceed the country's current electricity demand, offering a sustainable solution to its energy crisis.

Next up, we have some tech news. Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro update now has the ability to process audio inputs directly, a significant leap in the model's capabilities. The model's enhanced efficiency and comprehension capabilities set a new benchmark for operational effectiveness in Google's AI offerings. Google also announced updates to another major AI model, Imagen 2, and revealed plans to integrate real-time information from Google Search into AI responses.

In sports news, South African Rugby had to arrange travel for the Bulls' players and coaches on eight different flights for their upcoming Champions Cup quarter-final match against Northampton in England. This situation was due to the late confirmation of match details. Despite these challenges, SA Rugby managed to book thirty-three business class and five economy class seats for the team.

In more sports news, 22-year-old professional golfer Akshay Bhatia secured the last spot in the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club with a victory at the Texas Open. His journey to the Masters is notable, having participated in the Drive, Chip, and Putt event at Augusta National as a 12-year-old. Bhatia's Masters appearance is an opportunity to cement his status among the game's elite.

At the South African Swimming Championships, 19-year-old Pieter Coetzé emerged victorious in the 100m freestyle race, narrowly defeating veteran Chad le Clos. Coetzé, aiming for an Olympic qualifying time, expressed satisfaction with his performance, considering the limited rest before the championship and his focus on the upcoming Paris Olympics.

Our final story for today is about the drug Ozempic. Originally developed for type 2 diabetes, Ozempic belongs to a class of drugs that not only improve diabetes management but also facilitate weight loss. The journey from understanding incretins to developing effective medications involved groundbreaking work on hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, leading to the utilization of a venomous lizard's toxin for its stable incretin-mimicking properties.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me, Erika, on the 'Just a Moment News' podcast. Stay informed and have a great day!
