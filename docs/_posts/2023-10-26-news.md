### Transcript

Good morning and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is October 26, 2023. Let's get into today's headlines.

First up, the World Bank has granted South Africa a 19 billion Rand loan to support the country's energy reform. South Africa heavily relies on coal for electricity, which has led to regular power cuts due to the old and unreliable plants owned by Eskom Holdings. With this loan, the World Bank aims to help restructure the power sector by unbundling Eskom and improving its efficiency. The funding will also encourage private investment in renewable energy and strengthen carbon pricing instruments [Moneyweb].

In other news, a cache of old coins has been discovered in a Welsh field and declared treasure. The coins, which are over 2,000 years old, were found by David Moss and Tom Taylor using metal detectors. After years of excavation and identification, the 2,733 coins, some dating back to 32 years after the birth of Christ, have been confirmed to be Roman silver and copper-alloy coins. Researchers believe they may have been offerings to a deity, considering the presence of a nearby third-century temple. These coins will be displayed at the Llandudno Museum [New York Post].

Moving on, Endeavor Group Holding, the owner of WME talent agency and various sports properties, is exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale. However, the company has ruled out selling its controlling stake in TKO Group Holdings, which combines UFC and WWE. This exploration comes as Endeavor's market value has declined in 2023. The timeline and outcome of the review are uncertain [Vox].

In art news, recent research suggests that Leonardo da Vinci used toxic pigments when painting the Mona Lisa. The study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society reveals that da Vinci might have used plumbonacrite, a compound formed when lead oxides mix with oil. This finding provides insight into da Vinci's techniques and may contribute to preservation efforts for his remaining works [Ars Technica].

Next, a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine highlights the health benefits of a brisk 22-minute walk. The research shows that this level of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can offset the risks associated with prolonged sitting. The study analyzed data from over 11,000 individuals aged over 50 and found that even lesser amounts of physical activity can reduce mortality risk. This supports the UK chief medical officer's recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week [The Guardian].

Lastly, Pick n Pay, a South African retailer, is offering free rugby-themed T-shirt printing to celebrate the Springboks' Rugby World Cup performance. The promotion is available at 12 stores across the country, and customers need to purchase a T-shirt in-store to avail of the free printing. The offer has generated significant interest, and the final printing sessions will take place later this week at select locations [News24].

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
