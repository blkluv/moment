Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest news on this first day of 2024. Let's dive right into the stories making headlines today.

First up, Amazon is making major moves in South Africa, advertising 50 full-time positions and one seasonal job opening. This is part of the e-commerce giant's plan to establish a marketplace in the country, with the roles ranging from customer service lead to transportation and fulfilment manager. Amazon's general manager for the Sub-Saharan Africa region, Robert Koen, expressed excitement about the launch, stating it provides local sellers and entrepreneurs an opportunity to grow their businesses. Despite facing some legal and technological challenges, Amazon is set to launch Amazon.co.za later this year.

In other news, Takealot, a prominent online retailer, has temporarily suspended its alcohol sales since 21 December 2023. This move, which occurred during the peak season for liquor sales, has led to speculation among users that the suspension might be due to an expired liquor licence. The actual reason, however, remains unclear as Takealot has yet to provide an explanation.

Turning to education, a News24 survey reveals a significant trend among prospective students in South Africa. The Bachelor of Education degree and health professions, including medicine, have emerged as top choices at many universities. This trend is driven by a desire to make a difference in people's lives and the promise of job security in sectors like education.

In international news, former President Bill Clinton, identified as "John Doe 36," is mentioned over 50 times in court documents related to a 2015 lawsuit by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. The references are mainly due to Giuffre's attempts to compel Clinton to testify against Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. However, the documents do not implicate Clinton in illegal activities.

On the archaeological front, researchers have found evidence supporting the Biblical account of the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem around 586 BCE. The findings include burned wooden beams and layers of ash dating back to the period of the city's destruction, suggesting a deliberate act of destruction rather than an accidental fire.

In a tragic turn of events, two-time Olympian and former world champion cyclist, Melissa Hoskins, was killed after being struck by a ute driven by her husband, Rohan Dennis, in Adelaide. Dennis has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, driving without due care, and endangering life. The incident is currently under investigation.

In sports, tennis star Rafael Nadal made his long-awaited return to professional tennis at the Brisbane International. Despite losing his comeback match, Nadal showed promise and is set to face Dominic Thiem in singles.

Finally, in entertainment news, comedian Dave Chappelle has returned with a new Netflix stand-up special, "The Dreamer." The special marks a shift from his previous works, with Chappelle diversifying his subjects and addressing the backlash he received from the transgender community.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', wishing you a great start to 2024.
