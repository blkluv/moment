### Transcript

Hello, this is Erika, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News' on this beautiful day of April 18, 2024. Let's dive right into today's stories.

We're starting off with a story that's inspiring millions. Siya Kolisi, the captain of South Africa's national rugby team, has been named one of the 100 most influential people of 2024. Kolisi's influence goes beyond the rugby pitch; he's a figure of unity and hope in a nation that's faced its fair share of challenges. His leadership has been instrumental during political turmoil, an energy crisis, and the ongoing pandemic. Beyond his sporting prowess, Kolisi's humility and leadership qualities have earned him respect and admiration across diverse communities in South Africa, breaking significant racial barriers in a historically white-dominated sport.

Moving on, DStv has launched a new channel, 1Max, which started airing from April 1, 2024. It's accessible to Premium and Compact Plus subscribers and features a selection of shows from MultiChoice’s streaming service Showmax, including newly released titles. It also broadcasts content from across Africa, along with international series. This initiative aims to introduce Showmax’s offerings to DStv viewers, encouraging them to subscribe to the full streaming service for a broader content selection.

In sports, Stellenbosch FC is making waves in the DStv Premiership, extending their unbeaten streak to twenty-two games across all competitions. Their latest match against Sekhukhune United ended in a draw, keeping them in contention for second place and a potential CAF Champions League spot.

Next up, we have some exciting news from Hollywood. Veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese is embarking on two ambitious projects. One is an independent film adaptation of Shūsaku Endō's 1973 novel, "Life of Jesus", and the other is a biopic of Frank Sinatra, potentially starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence. Scorsese's contemporaries, like Ridley Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, David Cronenberg, and Paul Schrader, are also contributing significantly to cinema with their new projects. This trend shows that age is seen as an asset in the film industry, bringing a wealth of experience and a refined creative vision.

In a surprising twist, Karl-Erivan Haub, a German-American retail tycoon who was declared dead in 2018, may be living in Moscow with a younger Russian woman named Veronika Ermilova. A recent investigation by German broadcaster RTL suggests that Haub may have faked his own death, sparking intrigue and speculation about his activities and the true nature of his disappearance.

In the world of technology, Boston Dynamics has debuted a new all-electric Atlas robot, signaling a shift towards commercialization. The new Atlas is smaller, lighter, and more agile than its predecessor, featuring a streamlined design with consumer-friendly elements. Boston Dynamics hints at future developments in gripper technology to enhance its functionality in various environments.

Finally, a group of three hundred and fifty-three young ballet dancers from various countries gathered at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to break the Guinness World Record for the Most Ballet Dancers En Pointe Simultaneously. This achievement not only demonstrates their dedication and skill but also marks a significant moment in the careers of these young dancers.

And that wraps up our news for today. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed, stay curious, and see you next time.
