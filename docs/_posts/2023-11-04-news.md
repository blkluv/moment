### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is November 4th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, who recently disclosed on Instagram that he tore his ACL while training for an MMA fight. He will need surgery and is currently in recovery. Despite this setback, Zuckerberg remains committed to participating in the competition once he recovers. He also expressed his appreciation for the medical team's care and shared pictures of his post-operative state, including his wife Priscilla Chan tending to him.

Moving on, Afghanistan secured a commanding seven-wicket victory over the Netherlands in a crucial World Cup fixture. This win marks their fourth victory in the tournament, putting them in contention for the semifinal spots alongside Australia and New Zealand. Rahmat Shah and Hashmatullah Shahidi played pivotal roles with the bat, both registering their third consecutive half-centuries. The Netherlands, who batted first, were bowled out for 179, with run-outs undermining their innings. Afghanistan's bowling, led by Mohammad Nabi, and their strong fielding contributed to their success. This win sets up an important match against Australia on Tuesday.

In other news, South Africa's men's and women's hockey teams are on the verge of qualifying for the Paris Olympics. Both teams won their semifinal matches at the continental tournament in Pretoria, positioning themselves for potential Olympic qualification.

Next, NASA's spacecraft, Lucy, made an intriguing discovery during its visit to the minor asteroid Dinkinesh. It found that the asteroid has its own tiny moon companion. This discovery was made during Wednesday's flyby, with the spacecraft confirming the size of Dinkinesh to be barely half a mile and its moon to be one-tenth of a mile. Lucy's mission is to explore asteroids in the solar system, and this find adds to its list of exciting discoveries.

Moving on to Colombia, authorities are addressing the overpopulation of hippos descended from those originally imported by Pablo Escobar. Plans are being made to cull, sterilize, or export some of the 166 animals to control their numbers. The herd has become invasive, and experts warn of the risks they pose to humans and native species. Animal activists, however, oppose sterilization due to the associated risks and suffering.

Lastly, a restaurant owner has gone viral for adding a $50 "unable to parent" fee to a mother's bill and yelling at her. This incident, which occurred at Toccoa Riverside Restaurant, has sparked mixed reactions. Leadership expert Chelsea Jay criticized the owner's behavior, deeming it inappropriate and a sign of poor communication. Jay advises clear policies and workplace standards to avoid conflicts, and emphasizes the importance of avoiding yelling, as it can negatively affect the workplace atmosphere.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, and I'll see you next time. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
