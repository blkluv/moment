Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for today, November 7, 2023. Let's get started.

First up, OpenAI, the renowned artificial intelligence company, has announced new products called GPTs, which will allow users to create customized versions of their ChatGPT. This move is seen as a step towards an agent-based future. OpenAI is also launching the GPT Store, where verified builders can offer their services and earn money based on usage. The company's GPT-4 model is highly advanced, but it faces competition from free and open-source models that can be tailored to specific needs. OpenAI has made its products more customizable and reduced their prices, which has been well-received by developers. This development will enable developers to offer products powered by OpenAI models at lower costs or with better profit margins.

Moving on, Cape Town's Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden has been crowned the best botanical garden in Africa by the World Luxury Travel Awards. The awards are determined by public votes and recognize travel destinations across various categories on a global scale. Kirstenbosch, managed by the SA National Biodiversity Institute, is known for its contribution to biodiversity conservation and offers visitors a beautiful space to explore South Africa's natural heritage. The garden's team is thrilled to receive this prestigious accolade and aims to create unforgettable moments for visitors.

In the world of sports, Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), has announced three title fights that will headline three pay-per-view events in early 2024. One of the notable matchups is between Dricus Du Plessis, a South African middleweight contender, and current champion Sean Strickland. Du Plessis, with an impressive MMA record, will have the opportunity to fight for the title after Khamzat Chimaev's injury altered the expected title challenge lineup. This presents an exciting opportunity for Du Plessis to capitalize on the shuffled division dynamics and potentially become the new champion.

Shifting our focus to South Africa, the country is facing the risk of losing business investment due to visa "chaos." An acute shortage of skilled workers, particularly in engineering, science, information technology, and management-level positions, is hindering economic growth and job creation. The visa system, managed by the government's home affairs department, is causing delays in the process, with visa applications taking up to 48 weeks to be accepted. This situation has prompted some foreign investors to consider moving their investments elsewhere, which could further impact the country's economy and high unemployment rate.

Lastly, Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, is contemplating his future with Spotify as his contract is set to expire next year. Rogan's options include creating his own media company or collaborating with Elon Musk's platform. His potential departure poses a challenge for Spotify, as the company is already managing high costs while trying to retain its top content providers. Spotify's focus on high-profile podcasts, such as those by the Obamas and Kim Kardashian, has not yielded the expected financial returns. As a result, the company has been prioritizing cost efficiency, leading to its first quarterly profit since 2021. Rogan's decision will be eagerly anticipated, given his podcast's immense popularity and the ongoing financial recalibration at Spotify.

And that wraps up today's news stories. Stay tuned for more updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off. Have a great day!
