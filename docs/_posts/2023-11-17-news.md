### Transcript

Good day, listeners! Welcome back to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 17, 2023. Let's dive into the headlines for today:

In our first story, Australia emerged victorious in a thrilling semi-final match against South Africa in the Cricket World Cup. South Africa's decision to bat first didn't go as planned, with Australia's pace attack causing early trouble for them. Despite a century by David Miller, South Africa was bowled out for 212. Chasing the target, Australia started aggressively but faced a tough challenge from South Africa's spinners. However, they managed to edge past the target with the help of an unlikely partnership between Cummins and Starc. The Proteas' captain, Temba Bavuma, acknowledged Australia's outstanding performance and reflected on his team's missed opportunities.

Moving on to our next story, an 18-year-old matric pupil from Cape Town had the opportunity to see his design showcased on a plane during the Springboks' victory parade after the Rugby World Cup. Taariq Hendricks, an aviation enthusiast, created a livery design for FlySafair, which caught the attention of the airline's CEO. The design, blending the airline's colors with green and gold, was used for a new Springbok livery. Taariq, who is pursuing a career in aviation, expressed his excitement and pride in collaborating with FlySafair.

In a surprising development, an AI-powered drawing app called tldraw has stunned developers by turning sketches into functional games. The app's new feature, "Make It Real," utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4V API to convert vector drawings into Tailwind CSS and JavaScript web code. Designers and developers have been impressed by its capabilities, creating interactive user interfaces and even games like Breakout. This breakthrough in software development hints at a transformative future where AI plays a crucial role in turning visual concepts into real-world applications.

Moving on to social media news, TikTok has taken action to remove videos promoting Osama bin Laden's hate-filled letter justifying the September 11 attacks. The videos were found to violate TikTok's rules on not supporting any form of terrorism. TikTok stated that they are actively removing this content and investigating how it appeared on the platform. The videos quoting bin Laden's letter had also surfaced on other social media platforms, sparking a debate about the platform's responsibility in preventing the spread of such content.

And finally, in a surprising announcement, Snoop Dogg revealed on Instagram that he is giving up smoking. Known for his association with smoking, this decision surprised many of his fans. Snoop had previously attempted to quit smoking but resumed later. This announcement comes in contrast to his colleague Wiz Khalifa's decision to increase his smoke intake while quitting alcohol. If Snoop's decision is genuine, it marks a significant change in his lifestyle.

That's all the news we have for you today. Remember to stay informed and have a great day! This is Erika signing off for Just a Moment News.
