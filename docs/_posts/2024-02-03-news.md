### Transcript

Hello everyone, it's Erika here with 'Just a Moment News' on this 3rd day of February, 2024. Let's dive into the top stories making headlines today.

First up, we have some exciting news from the Africa Cup of Nations. South Africa's national football team, Bafana Bafana, is making waves with an upset victory against Morocco, taking them to the quarterfinals. This success is attributed to the influence of Mamelodi Sundowns, a top club in South Africa. There's some debate about the effectiveness of Sundowns' approach to player development, but the optimism for Bafana Bafana to go far in the tournament is high. The team's success is seen as a result of collective determination and a strong team mentality.

In the business world, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, saw his net worth increase by more than $28 billion in just one morning. This comes after Meta’s share price skyrocketed following the company’s announcement of its first-ever cash dividend program. While dividends are often criticized for artificially inflating the stock price, they do reward investors for just holding the stock. This news comes on the heels of Zuckerberg's recent Senate Judiciary Committee testimony about the risks posed by social media to young people.

Moving on to sports, elite distance runners Conner Mantz and Clayton Young took an unconventional route to becoming the top two male qualifiers for the U.S. Olympic marathon trials. They paused their running careers for two years to go on missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This break from training provided them with unexpected mental advantages and a more balanced identity beyond sports, reducing performance pressure.

In tech news, Apple's new Vision Pro virtual-reality headset is creating a buzz. The device, which resembles ski goggles, allows users to overlay digital content on the real world. It's drawn a crowd of eager Apple enthusiasts, including CEO Tim Cook. Despite its hefty price tag of $3,500, many believe the Vision Pro could eventually replace the iPhone and are excited to be part of this technological milestone.

In entertainment news, we sadly report the passing of Carl Weathers, known for his iconic role as Apollo Creed in the "Rocky" film series. He passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 76. Weathers had a diverse and prolific career in film and television, including roles in "Predator," "Happy Gilmore," and the Star Wars series, "The Mandalorian."

In podcasting news, Spotify has signed a new deal with podcaster Joe Rogan, worth up to $250 million over multiple years. This agreement includes an upfront minimum guarantee and a revenue-sharing arrangement based on ad sales. Despite past controversies, Spotify continues to support Rogan's show in its quest to become the world's largest audio platform.

Finally, in more football news, goalkeeper Ronwen Williams is on the verge of matching Andre Arendse's legendary Afcon record of not conceding in four matches. Despite facing early doubts in his career, Williams has become a dependable leader for Bafana Bafana. His transformation from a heavily criticized goalkeeper to one of the best in Africa is attributed to his unwavering professionalism, hard work, and determination.

And that's a wrap for today's news. I'm Erika, and you've been listening to 'Just a Moment News'. Thank you for tuning in, and we'll see you next time.
