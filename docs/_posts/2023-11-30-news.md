Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 30, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, Taylor Swift has dropped a surprise vault song to celebrate being Spotify's top global artist of 2023. Swift released the song "You're Losing Me (From The Vault)" on streaming platforms as a thank you to her fans. She had an incredible year, with billions of global streams and successful albums and tours.

Next, the City of Johannesburg is facing criticism for planning to spend R2.6 million on a year-end event for long-serving employees. The extravagant expenditure includes items like flowers, jackets, watches, and expensive gifts. Many are questioning the appropriateness of this spending, especially considering the city's financial struggles and decaying infrastructure.

In another story, Elon Musk responded bluntly to a question about regaining advertisers on the social network formerly known as Twitter. Musk's controversial actions and statements have sparked significant controversy and concern among businesses and public figures.

Moving on, there is unease among the staff at OpenAI after Sam Altman's ouster and subsequent return as CEO. The company is in a different place now, and investors and potential employees are considering the implications of Altman's removal. OpenAI still holds the most advanced AI model on the market, but its competitors are using the recent drama to their advantage.

In climate news, Mozambique is set to unveil an ambitious $80 billion energy-transition plan at COP28. The plan aims to attract foreign investment to enhance renewable energy and promote electric vehicles. This highlights the need for rich countries to invest in poorer nations facing severe impacts of global warming.

In the tech world, South African startup GoMetro has raised Â£9 million in a Series A funding round. The company specializes in fleet management and its logistics optimization software has attracted significant investment. GoMetro plans to expand its operations and integrate more electric and diesel vehicles onto its platform.

Lastly, a deep learning tool called GNoME has discovered millions of new materials, including stable materials suitable for future technologies. This AI tool has significantly accelerated material discovery, offering potential candidates for experimental synthesis. The project demonstrates the potential of AI in material science and the development of sustainable technologies.

And that's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
