Hello everyone, this is Erika, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News' on this 19th day of April, 2024. We've got some interesting stories to discuss today, so let's dive right in.

First up, we have news from the tech world. Apple has been directed to remove WhatsApp and Threads, both owned by Meta, from its app store in China. This comes from an order by China's Cyberspace Administration, citing national security concerns. Other messaging apps like Signal and Telegram have also been affected by this move. This isn't a new move for China, as the country has a history of controlling internet content. It's also worth noting that this action is part of a broader conflict between China and the U.S. over technology and cybersecurity, with the U.S. House of Representatives preparing to vote on legislation targeting ByteDance's TikTok. Apple's compliance is part of its strategy to keep its business operations within legal frameworks globally, despite potential disagreements with these types of orders.

In other tech news, Meta Platforms, the company behind Facebook, has introduced its latest AI model, Llama 3. This model powers Meta's in-app AI assistant, MetaAI, and enhances content feeds, ad targeting, and virtual reality experiences. Llama 3 is an improvement over last year's model, Llama 2, and is part of Meta's significant investment in AI technology. Future updates and iterations of Llama 3 are planned, underscoring Meta's commitment to continuous improvement in its AI capabilities.

Moving to the world of sports, the award-winning documentary series "Chasing the Sun" is now available for free global viewing on RugbyPass TV. The series follows the Springboks' challenging journey towards reclaiming their status as champions at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. The documentary provides an intimate portrayal of the team and coaching staff as they navigate through intense preparations and grueling training sessions. It captures the highs and lows of their quest, emphasizing the immense pressure they faced while carrying the hopes of a nation yearning for joy.

In e-commerce news, Zando, a South African online fashion retailer, has launched Zando Global. This move positions the company as a local contender to Chinese fast-fashion e-commerce giants Shein and Temu. Zando Global aims to alleviate consumer concerns regarding international ordering by ensuring easy access to products with reliable delivery and straightforward returns. This strategic launch represents an effort to capitalize on the expanded market for online shopping while addressing common customer hesitations associated with international e-commerce.

Shoprite is undertaking a significant rewrite of its Checkers Sixty60 app. Despite the app's popularity, it has faced criticism for its functionality. Common complaints include issues with updating delivery instructions, irrelevant search results, frequent stock shortages, limited store selection for orders, unreliable driver tracking, and occasional pricing errors. However, despite these challenges, Shoprite asserts that Sixty60 is very profitable.

In entertainment news, Taylor Swift's new album, *The Tortured Poets Department*, explores themes of grief and heartbreak. The album quickly gained significant attention, becoming Spotifyâ€™s most pre-saved album ever. It serves as a follow-up to her acclaimed *Midnights* album, retaining connections with fans through its lyrical introspection and emotional resonance.

Lastly, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the US has made significant strides in integrating artificial intelligence into air combat. The recent breakthrough occurred in September 2023 when DARPA successfully tested this AI system in an actual dogfight scenario against a human pilot. This development has caught the attention of many, including the Pentagon, which as per reports from The Wall Street Journal, is interested in expanding AI applications to enhance its drone fleet and overall defense capabilities.

And that wraps up our news for today. Thanks for joining me, Erika, on 'Just a Moment News'. We'll see you next time.
