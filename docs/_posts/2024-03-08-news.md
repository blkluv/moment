Hello, this is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this 8th day of March, 2024. Let's dive into today's top stories.

First up, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee has given the nod to a bill that could potentially lead to a ban on the popular social media platform, TikTok, in the United States. The committee unanimously approved the bill, which provides TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, 165 days to sell the platform. Failure to do so could result in app stores like Apple and Google being prohibited from offering TikTok for download. This move is seen as a significant step towards addressing national security concerns related to TikTok's Chinese ownership. However, ByteDance and TikTok are not going down without a fight, arguing that the bill infringes on Americans' First Amendment rights.

Moving on to the world of entertainment, the Oscars 2024 predictions are in. The film "Oppenheimer" is the clear favorite for Best Picture, while Christopher Nolan is expected to clinch Best Director. Cillian Murphy, recognized for his role in "Oppenheimer," is a strong contender for Best Actor. However, the Best Actress category remains a toss-up between Lily Gladstone and Emma Stone.

In tech news, ElevenLabs, a billion-dollar startup, has developed AI technology for cloning voices, but an investigative report revealed a loophole in their system that allows the cloning of voices, including that of President Joe Biden. This raises significant concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI tools.

Netflix is taking a new direction in sports, announcing its next major event, a fight between YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. The bout, which will stream live on Netflix, is part of Netflix's steady expansion into sports.

The FX limited series "Shogun" has made a remarkable debut, amassing 9 million global streaming views for its first episode. The series, set in 17th century feudal Japan, has been lauded for its cultural accuracy and intricate world-building. However, the possibility of a second season remains uncertain.

Lastly, the Johannesburg Zoo is celebrating its 120th anniversary this month. The zoo has announced a reduced entry fee for its birthday month, sparking enthusiasm from the public. However, the National Council of SPCA's Jacques Peacock has criticized the existence of zoos in urban settings, arguing for genuine conservation and sanctuaries over zoos.

That's all for today's edition of 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, signing off. Stay informed and have a great day!
