Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' today, January 21, 2024. I've got some interesting stories to share with you today, so let's jump right in!

In the world of UFC, Dricus Du Plessis has claimed the UFC middleweight title in a split decision victory over Sean Strickland at UFC 297. This much-anticipated match lasted five grueling rounds, with both fighters demonstrating their resilience and skill. Du Plessis's win was a significant victory, marking a historic moment for his homeland, South Africa. Despite the animosity leading up to the bout, Du Plessis acknowledged Strickland's strength and skill, while Strickland graciously accepted his defeat.

Switching gears to tennis, Novak Djokovic and Aryna Sabalenka have both made their way into the Australian Open quarter-finals. Djokovic displayed remarkable form and dominated his match against Adrian Mannarino, while defending champion Sabalenka powered through Amanda Anisimova. The tournament has also seen other notable matches and has witnessed the unexpected elimination of many top seeds, setting the stage for potentially new champions in both the men's and women's draws.

In a tragic turn of events, Vistex CEO Sanjay Shah tragically lost his life during a grand entrance at a celebration event for Vistex Asia's silver jubilee. Shah and President Vishwanath Raju Datla were being lowered onto the stage in an iron cage when a wire snapped, causing the cage to drop 15 feet to the ground. This incident has left a notable impact on the company and its global presence.

In the realm of cryptocurrency, GS Partners, a crypto scheme associated with prominent sports figures Victor Matfield, Herschelle Gibbs, and Lucas Radebe, is facing warnings from authorities. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority of South Africa has issued a warning that GS Partners is not licensed to provide financial services or products in the country.

Meanwhile, the South African Air Force is facing criticism for using its sole operational VIP plane, the Falcon 50, for transporting President Cyril Ramaphosa and Deputy President Paul Mashatile to the ANC's birthday celebrations in Mbombela. The utilization of military aircraft for such events has sparked criticism, especially considering the guidelines against using military resources for political purposes.

In rugby news, the DHL Stormers came from behind to beat a stubborn Stade Francais side in Paris, securing a home Champions Cup playoff. A 71st-minute try from Manie Libbok gave the Stormers a bonus-point 24-20 victory in a thrilling encounter.

And finally, in the world of gaming, Lucasfilm and Bethesda's upcoming video game, "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle," is set in 1937, filling the timeline between "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Last Crusade." The game features a younger Indiana Jones embarking on a new archaeological quest and is set in various global locations from the Vatican to the Himalayas.
