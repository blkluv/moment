### Transcript

Hello everyone! This is Erika on the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, and today is February 20, 2024. Let's dive right into the news.

First up, we have a heartwarming story from Australia. Daniel Timms, driven by his father's heart failure, has pioneered the development of the world's first durable artificial heart. This revolutionary device uses levitating titanium technology and diverges from traditional heart designs by eschewing pulsation for a continuous flow. The Australian government has invested fifty million dollars in the project, recognizing its potential to transform heart failure treatment. The artificial heart could eliminate the need for heart transplants for some patients, marking a significant departure from the limitations of current heart transplantation and mechanical support devices.

Next, we move to South Africa, where the Western Cape government has announced a significant financial commitment of seven billion Rand over the next three years to combat the impacts of load shedding in the province. Premier Alan Winde expressed optimism about the Western Cape's potential to become the first province to overcome load shedding challenges. This ambitious plan involves a substantial investment aimed at enhancing energy resilience through partnerships with the private sector.

In technology news, Afrimat, a JSE-listed mining company, has been battling impersonation scams on Telegram for nearly two years. Scammers have created fake Telegram and WhatsApp accounts offering fraudulent services such as investment brokering and cryptocurrency trading. Despite Afrimat's legal efforts to combat these scams, Telegram's support has been criticized as ineffective. This problem is not unique to Afrimat, as Telegram scams have become a global issue, underscoring the challenges companies face in protecting their identity and customers from online scams.

Back to South Africa, the Gauteng Provincial Government has announced plans to officially discontinue the e-toll system by March 31, 2024. This decision comes after longstanding public opposition to the e-tolls in Gauteng. The Gauteng provincial government has committed to developing a new model for revenue enhancement that excludes tolling, marking the end of a contentious chapter in Gauteng's transport policy.

In space news, the European Remote Sensing 2 satellite, launched by the European Space Agency nearly thirty years ago, is set to re-enter Earth's atmosphere this week in an uncontrolled descent due to the lack of fuel for a guided reentry. ESA has maintained transparency regarding the satellite's reentry, offering daily updates on its trajectory. The satellite's end-of-life reflects ESA's commitment to space sustainability and orbital debris reduction.

For movie lovers, Ridley Scott's biopic "Napoleon," starring Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby, is set to release on Apple TV+ on March 1. The film has garnered Academy Award nominations in categories such as Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. An extended version of the film is also set to be released on Apple TV+, promising more content that may address the critiques.

Lastly, the Al Kuwait, a livestock carrier ship carrying around nineteen thousand cattle, docked at Cape Town Harbour, causing a significant stench across Cape Town's Central Business District and surrounding areas. The National Council of SPCAs and Cape of Good Hope SPCA have been involved in inspecting the ship since its arrival, working to assess and ensure the welfare of the animals on board. The Al Kuwait's presence in Cape Town has prompted further scrutiny from both local authorities and international animal welfare groups regarding the treatment of livestock during transport.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika, signing off from the 'Just a Moment News' podcast. Stay informed, stay safe, and see you tomorrow!
