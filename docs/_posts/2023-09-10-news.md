### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for today, September 10, 2023.

Let's start with the UFC 293 event that took place recently. It was a night full of surprises, with the most shocking being Sean Strickland's upset win over Israel Adesanya for the middleweight title. Adesanya was the favorite going into the fight, especially since it was in Sydney, close to his home in New Zealand. However, Strickland, who was not even the first-choice opponent, dominated Adesanya and won by unanimous decision. This win highlights the current volatility in the UFC, where long championship reigns are becoming increasingly rare. It also poses a challenge for the UFC in how to handle Strickland's new championship status, considering his discriminatory comments. We'll have to wait and see if Strickland's reign will be short-lived or if he will make a lasting impact on the sport.

Moving on to tennis, we have Coco Gauff's magical run to the US Open title. Gauff, who gained fame at Wimbledon in 2019, recently won her first major tennis title at the US Open. Her journey to this point was not sudden; she has been steadily working her way up, adapting to fame and expectations. Gauff's determination and tactical and mental maturity were evident throughout her 2023 campaign. Despite facing various challenges, including a delay due to an environmental protestor, she remained focused and unyielding. This win makes Gauff the youngest American US Open champion since Serena Williams in 1999 and elevates her to a career-high world ranking of No. 3.

In other news, there is a legal battle happening between Siqu Zungu, a Durban businessman, and his landlord, Dr. Blaine Bloy. Zungu has been living rent-free in a R12m penthouse in Umhlanga Ridge for two years. He claims to have paid a down payment with intentions to buy the property, while Bloy insists that the agreement was for rent. Zungu's lawyer argues that Bloy retained the down payment even when their relationship soured. The matter is set to be heard in court in November, and Zungu faces the possibility of eviction and potential homelessness.

Now, let's talk about a new account surrounding the J.F.K. assassination. Paul Landis, a former Secret Service agent who was near President John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated in 1963, has come forward with a new recollection of the events. Landis challenges the official version of the "magic bullet" theory, claiming to have found the intact bullet in the back of the presidential limousine instead of the hospital where it was believed to have exited Governor John B. Connally Jr.'s body. While Landis's story has raised some doubts and critics argue that memories degrade over time, his perspective adds a new dimension to the ongoing debate surrounding the Kennedy assassination.

In tragic news, Morocco has been struck by a devastating 6.8 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake has resulted in over 1,000 deaths and 1,200 injuries so far, with Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains being particularly affected. King Mohammed VI has mobilized armed forces for rescue operations and the construction of field hospitals. Citizens are camping out in fear of building collapses, and there have been generous blood donations. Global leaders have pledged support, including Algeria, despite the severed ties between the two countries in 2021. Infrastructure and historic sites have sustained damage, and first responders are facing logistical challenges due to blocked roads.

Lastly, we have a heartwarming story of a 7-year-old who discovered a 2.95-carat diamond while visiting a state park in Arkansas. Aspen Brown, the lucky youngster, found the diamond while celebrating her seventh birthday at the Crater of Diamonds State Park. This discovery is the second-largest registered by a park guest this year. The park officials confirmed that Brown had indeed found a diamond, describing it as beautiful and complete. It's worth noting that one or two visitors discover diamonds at the park each day, and over 75,000 diamonds have been found there since their discovery on the land. The park is known for its unique geology, which also yields other precious gems like amethysts and garnets.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
