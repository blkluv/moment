### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast, where we bring you the top news stories of the day. Today is February 26, 2024, and we have a lot to discuss, so let's get started.

First up, we're talking about sport climbing, a discipline that made its debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics. This year, the 2024 Olympics in Paris will feature Aniya Holder, a 22-year-old speed climber from Gqeberha, South Africa. Holder's journey to the Olympics is not just a personal achievement but a testament to the growing appeal and competitive nature of speed climbing. Her commitment and strategic shift to speed climbing, coupled with her innovative approach to training and funding, exemplify the evolving dynamics of Olympic sport climbing.

Next, we have an inspiring story from South Africa. Renias Mhlongo and his partner have redefined conservation and community empowerment by establishing a school for trackers, aiming to revive and preserve the ancient African craft of animal tracking for wildlife conservation. Their venture, Tshokwane River Camp, stands as a beacon of hope, unity, and the tangible impact of shared vision and tenacity in overcoming the odds.

In sports news, Liverpool secured their 10th League Cup victory in a thrilling encounter against Chelsea at Wembley. This triumph marks Liverpool's first trophy since Jurgen Klopp announced his departure at the season's end, potentially kick-starting an unforgettable farewell tour for the German manager. This victory not only cements Liverpool's status as a formidable force in English football but also sets the stage for an electrifying conclusion to Klopp's tenure.

In tech news, Uber Technologies is negotiating a potential investment in Moove, an African vehicle-financing start-up. Moove offers a novel credit-scoring system that enables drivers, particularly those unable to secure traditional vehicle financing, to purchase new vehicles for use in ride-hailing, logistics, and delivery services. The company's innovative approach to financing in a rapidly digitalizing Africa positions it alongside other significant fintech ventures like Flutterwave and Interswitch.

In entertainment news, Walt Disney Co. and Reliance Industries Ltd. have reached a significant agreement to merge their media operations in India. This collaboration reflects both companies' responses to the challenges and opportunities in India's rapidly expanding entertainment sector. This merger comes amidst broader consolidation trends within the Indian media landscape, underscoring the dynamic nature of the Indian entertainment market.

In the world of technology, Lenovo has introduced a concept for a transparent laptop called the ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop. While the ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop is still a concept and not yet a commercial product, Lenovo has expressed high confidence that the technologies demonstrated will make it into a real laptop within the next five years.

Finally, in the art world, a painting titled "The Adoration of the Kings" was initially thought to be the work of an artist in Rembrandt's circle. However, after re-examination by experts, it was reattributed to Rembrandt himself, which dramatically increased the painting's value. This story exemplifies the importance of attribution in the art market and how the opinion of a few experts can lead to wild fluctuations in price.

And that's all for today's 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, and it's been a pleasure bringing you the top stories of the day. Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time on 'Just a Moment News'.
