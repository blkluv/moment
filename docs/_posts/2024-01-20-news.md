Hello, this is Erika, and you're tuned into 'Just a Moment News' on this 20th day of January 2024. Let's dive into today's top stories.

First up, we've got a bit of a tussle brewing between the scientific community and Netflix. You see, Netflix has been making waves with its documentaries "Unknown: Cave of Bones" and "Ancient Apocalypse". They've garnered quite a bit of attention, but not all of it is positive. Scientists are questioning the credibility of these documentaries as they seem to veer away from established scientific consensus. Some have even criticized these shows for promoting unverified theories. It's a contentious issue, and it's sparking a wider debate about media responsibility when presenting scientific content.

Next, we have an inspiring story about a young man named Katlego. Hailing from a village in Limpopo, Katlego taught himself programming and now earns between 30 to 40000 rand per month. Despite facing numerous rejections, he persevered, honing his skills through online resources and eventually creating a music app for his compositions. His journey is a testament to the power of determination and self-learning.

Over in Japan, the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, has made a historic "soft landing" on the Moon. This makes Japan the fifth nation to achieve this feat. However, they've hit a bit of a snag as the lander's solar cells are not generating power. Despite this challenge, the mission is still considered a significant step for Japan's space exploration efforts.

In Switzerland, archaeologists have made an exciting discovery at the Kyburg Castle. They've unearthed a 14th-century medieval gauntlet, one of only six from this period in the region. The gauntlet is notable for its preservation and detailed craftsmanship, and researchers are now investigating its origins.

Now, let's head to South Africa, where the South African Heritage Resources Agency is challenging the auction of Nelson Mandela's personal items. The auction, which includes nearly 100 artifacts linked to the former president, is being contested due to concerns about the historical and cultural significance of these items.

In the world of sports, we bid farewell to distinguished South African referee Jaco Peyper. After an illustrious career that included three Rugby World Cups and refereeing 67 Tests, Peyper is retiring. His contributions to the sport, both on and off the field, have been praised by many in the rugby community.

In the literary world, Japanese author Rie Kudan has made headlines by using the AI program ChatGPT to write 5% of her award-winning novel "Tokyo-to Dojo-to". This highlights a growing trend of authors integrating AI into their writing process, which is sparking debates about the future of authorship.

Finally, in the podcast industry, AI is being used to generate virtual product placements. A company called Rembrand is leading the way in this area, using AI to seamlessly integrate ads into podcasts. This technology simplifies product placement and offers a new revenue stream for podcasters.

And that's all for today's 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, signing off until next time. Stay informed and stay safe.
