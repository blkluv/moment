Hello, this is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this fine day of February 4, 2024. Let's dive into today's news stories.

First up, we have a situation unfolding at Tesla and SpaceX that is raising eyebrows. The relationships between Elon Musk and the board members of these companies are under scrutiny due to their complex intertwining of personal and professional ties. One of the board members, Steve Jurvetson, found himself in hot water over some controversy, but Musk, who has close personal and financial relationships with Jurvetson and other board members, advocated for him to take a leave of absence rather than resign. This situation, along with Musk's own drug use, is causing concern among shareholders and governance experts about the effectiveness of the board in overseeing the CEO.

Next, we have a story of a young scientist making waves in the fight against skin cancer. Heman Bekele, at only 14 years old, has developed a soap that contains cancer-fighting chemicals. He plans to turn this project into a nonprofit organization by 2028 to provide equitable and accessible skin cancer treatment to a broader population. Heman is using his $25,000 award to support his project and further his education.

Moving on, let's revisit the VBS Mutual Bank scandal from 2018. Recently, KPMG, the auditor implicated in the scandal, has entered into a R500-million out-of-court settlement with the liquidator, Anoosh Rooplal. However, this settlement has been criticized for its lack of transparency, leaving many affected workers and municipality residents dissatisfied. The victims of the scandal, who have suffered significant financial losses, are still seeking justice and recovery of their lost funds.

In sports news, Bafana Bafana's assistant coach, Helman Mkhalele, led the team to victory in a dramatic penalty shootout, securing their spot in the Afcon semi-finals for the first time since 2000. Ronwen Williams played a crucial role in this victory, saving four penalties and matching a tournament record of four clean sheets.

In the world of collectibles, a collection of six Air Jordan sneakers worn by Michael Jordan during the Chicago Bulls' six NBA championship victories recently sold at auction for a record-breaking $8 million. This goes to show the enduring fascination with Michael Jordan's legacy in the world of sports collectibles.

Over in Egypt, archaeologists are undertaking a restoration project to reconstruct the Pyramid of Menkaure at Giza to its original appearance from 4,000 years ago. Despite some critics' concerns, the initiative is viewed as a significant effort to restore this ancient marvel and preserve Egypt's heritage.

Lastly, we have a South African cooler box brand, Fieldbar, which is experiencing tremendous growth. However, the company is facing the challenge of high demand, with every cooler box and water bottle listed on its website currently sold out. The company plans to produce 75,000 cooler boxes in 2024 and introduce new products to meet the growing demand.

That's all for today's news. This has been Erika with 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed, stay safe, and have a great day!
