Hello, everyone! Welcome to 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, and today is May 20th, 2024. Let's dive into some of today's significant news stories.

First up, we have a tragic update from Iran. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were both killed in a helicopter crash. The incident occurred during a difficult landing in a foggy, mountainous region of northwestern Iran. This happened after President Raisi had inaugurated a dam on the Iran-Azerbaijan border. Despite this tragic event, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has assured the nation that there will be no disruption in the country's affairs. President Raisi, known for his conservative stance and close ties with Khamenei, had been in office since August 2021.

Switching gears to sports, Manchester City has once again demonstrated their dominance in the world of football by clinching their fourth consecutive Premier League title. They secured this with a 3-1 victory over West Ham United. This season, they've shown remarkable consistency, finishing with six straight wins and a total of twenty goals scored, while only conceding two. Despite ongoing allegations of financial rule breaches, the team's success is often attributed to the strategic brilliance of their manager, Pep Guardiola.

In athletics, South African sprinter Akani Simbine has made headlines by setting a world-leading time of 9.90 seconds in the menâ€™s 100m at the Adidas Atlanta City Games. This marks his first sub-10-second performance of the season and places him at the top of the world list for this year. Simbine, a consistent figure in sprinting since the 2016 Rio Olympics, is shaping up to be a strong contender for the upcoming Paris Olympics.

From the world of politics and diaspora, South Africans living abroad have participated in a special voting event, with 78,000 citizens casting their votes ahead of the domestic voting scheduled for May 29. The voting abroad was described as a vibrant and celebratory event, with South Africans sharing cultural moments and reconnecting with their roots.

In space news, Blue Origin has successfully resumed crewed spaceflights with the NS-25 mission, which included the historic flight of 90-year-old Ed Dwight, the oldest person to fly in space. Despite a minor parachute issue during descent, the mission, which reached an altitude of approximately 106 kilometers, was completed safely, marking a significant achievement for Blue Origin.

Back on Earth, in the automotive industry, Enviro Automotive is set to launch the most affordable electric vehicle in South Africa, the Dayun S5 Mini SUV, by the end of 2024. Priced below four hundred thousand Rand, this vehicle is designed for urban use and features a range of 330 kilometers on a single charge.

Lastly, in maritime innovation, South African shipbuilder Legacy Marine is constructing an autonomous vessel, the "Prowler," for a Saudi Arabian client. This Unmanned Surface Vehicle, equipped with advanced AI and robotics, is expected to enhance navigation and safety in various maritime applications.

That wraps up our news for today. Thank you for tuning in to 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, and we'll see you next time for more updates. Stay informed and take care!
