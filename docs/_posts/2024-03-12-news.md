Hello, this is Erika from Just a Moment News. Today is March 12, 2024, and we have quite a few interesting news stories to discuss. Let's get started.

First off, we have some big news from the world of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of $72,201, thanks in large part to MicroStrategy Incorporated, which has purchased 12,000 Bitcoins for a whopping $821.7 million. This brings their total holdings to over 200,000 Bitcoins, making them the leading Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies. This bold move has seen their stock price skyrocket by 912% since 2020, with a 106% surge in the past month alone. Meanwhile, ARK Invest's CEO, Cathie Wood, has projected that Bitcoin could reach a value of $1 million by 2030, largely due to the expectation that the U.S. will approve spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds. However, some experts are warning of potential price corrections and increased selling pressure in the short term.

In other news, John Barnett, a former Boeing employee and whistleblower, has been found dead in the U.S. Barnett had previously accused Boeing workers of installing substandard parts in aircraft and raised concerns about significant failures in emergency oxygen systems. His death comes as Boeing is under scrutiny for production standards and safety protocols.

Moving on to business news, Takealot, a leading e-commerce company in South Africa, is reportedly considering the sale of its fashion subsidiary, Superbalist. This decision comes in response to increasing competition from Chinese online retailers such as Shein, Temu, and Wish.

Next, we have news from the tech giant, Apple. The company is reportedly testing an AI-powered ads platform with a select group of partners. The AI tool will choose where to place ads in various App Store promoted ad placement slots. This technology could eventually be used elsewhere as Apple expands its offering of ad-supported services.

In gaming news, a new indie game called Balatro has taken the gaming community by storm. This unique game combines elements of poker with a novel twist that focuses on maximizing numerical values rather than traditional poker strategies.

In real estate news, the City of Cape Town is auctioning a 99-year lease for a development block spanning 25,000 square meters. The auction is expected to attract an investment of one billion Rand and presents a unique opportunity for development in a prime location.

In the world of metaverse gaming, Readyverse Studios, in partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery, has announced an innovative platform known as "The Readyverse." Their first project, "Open," is a third-person battle royale game that features game-show-style competitions across various biomes.

Finally, in entertainment news, actor John Cena made headlines at the 2024 Oscars by appearing onstage seemingly nude. The comedic skit was a nod to a historical Oscars moment from 1974 when a streaker ran across the stage. However, it was later revealed that Cena was wearing a modesty patch and was not actually exposed.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
