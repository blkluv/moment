### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is September 3rd, 2023. Let's get into today's headlines.

First up, we have a story from News24 about the City of Johannesburg taking action to close a derelict building in Marshalltown. This decision comes after a tragic fire in the nearby Usindiso building that resulted in at least 76 deaths. During an official inspection, authorities found drug paraphernalia, illegal cigarettes, and alcohol in the building, declaring it a fire hazard. The city is facing legal complications as they cannot evict residents without providing proper and safe accommodation, which is currently lacking. In response, the building will be welded shut due to its hazardous conditions. The Usindiso building will also be sealed and guarded to prevent re-habitation. The identification of the victims has triggered a response from religious and foreign officials... [Source]

Moving on, we have a lighter story about the fourth season of The Great South African Bake Off (GSABO). This baking competition, hosted in Muldersdrift, follows the same format as its British counterpart but with a unique South African twist. The 12 contestants compete in a 10-episode series, facing themed rounds that include signature, technical, and showstopper challenges. As the challenges become more difficult, one baker is eliminated each week. The prize for the winner is not monetary, but the prestige of being crowned South Africa's best amateur baker. The judging panel consists of celebrity chef Siba Mtongana and newcomer Paul Hartmann, while the hosts, Lesego Tlhabi and Glen Biderman-Pam, provide some light-hearted moments. However, some contestants struggled with basic tasks, raising questions about the representation of the country's best amateur bakers... [Source]

Next, we have news about the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. The event was abruptly shut down by federal officials due to unsafe conditions caused by torrential rains. Over 73,000 participants were ordered to shelter in place as the weather deteriorated. The Bureau of Land Management closed access roads and predicted more rain in the coming days. The inclement weather also led to the closing of a nearby airport and halted the cleaning services for portable toilets at the festival. Many participants were left without cell service, drawing comparisons to the disastrous 2017 Fyre Festival. As of now, there are no immediate plans for the festival to resume... [Source]

In the world of sports, we have a story about the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and SuperSport failing to reach an agreement for the sub-licensing of the 2023 Rugby World Cup's broadcast rights. This failure may limit the accessibility of the tournament to South African fans, as the SABC's wide reach makes sports events broadly available. With the start of the Rugby World Cup just days away, rugby fans are left uncertain about how they will be able to view the upcoming games... [Source]

Lastly, we have news about Prince Albert II of Monaco facing dual crises. On one front, a WikiLeaks-style website has leaked information accusing key members of his inner circle of corruption and fraud. The leaks also suggest undue influence over Monaco's real estate market. In parallel, Prince Albert is dealing with rumors about the health of his marriage to Princess Charlene. She is reportedly living in Switzerland and meeting him "by appointment." French police have raided homes outside Monaco connected to those accused in the leaks. The future of the Grimaldi family's 800-year rule over Monaco is now being questioned, as these crises have caused unease within the palace and among the public... [Source]
