### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and here are today's headlines for September 25, 2023.

First up, we have an exclusive story about a corruption cover-up involving South Africa's Health Minister, Joe Phaahla. The Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has ordered Minister Phaahla to act on a 1.2 billion Rand corruption investigation report. Failure to comply could result in a two-year imprisonment. The case originated from Dr. Buyani Makhubu, a former supply-chain management director who claims he had no role in the corruption. The minister had requested a postponement to verify the report, but the court dismissed it. Internal sources suggest that Phaahla was actively covering up corruption, although the health department denies these allegations.

Next, in Hollywood, the writers strike may be coming to an end. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has reached a tentative agreement with major Hollywood studios on pay and working conditions after more than 140 days of work stoppage. The details of the agreement are yet to be shared, as it needs to be finalized and sent to members for a vote. If approved, the strike may end as soon as Tuesday. It's worth noting that the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is still on strike, which means Hollywood productions may remain at a standstill without actors.

Moving on, South Africa recently experienced destructive storm surges along its coastal regions. A combination of a storm surge caused by a low-pressure weather system, strong onshore winds, and high tides led to the devastation. The South African Weather Service issued a warning, but the overall impact was difficult to anticipate. To mitigate such risks in the future, standard emergency measures like those employed in Florida for hurricanes could be applied.

In space news, NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission has successfully returned pieces of an asteroid to Earth. This marks the United States' first asteroid sampling endeavor. Despite facing obstacles such as loss of the project's lead scientist and an overfilled collection chamber, the mission's capsule parachuted safely into the Utah desert. The sample is expected to provide valuable data on the origins of life and the early Solar System. However, there may be a potential delay in sample analysis due to political uncertainties in Washington D.C.

Shifting gears, we have an inside look at the moments leading up to the collapse of FTX, a financial company. Aditya Baradwaj, a former software engineer at Alameda Research, revealed that a declined company credit card during a routine takeout order signaled financial doom. This occurred before a tumultuous all-hands meeting, where CEO Caroline Ellison implicated founder Sam Bankman-Fried in allegedly misusing FTX customer deposits. Baradwaj and his colleagues subsequently left Hong Kong, and the company eventually declared bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried now faces multiple charges, including securities fraud and money laundering.

In the world of jewelry, Pandora is capitalizing on the rising demand for lab-grown diamonds. The company sees the lab-grown diamond sector as an incremental gross profit opportunity, enabling it to move up-market. Unlike high-end jewelers, Pandora finds the category lucrative and has expanded its lab-grown diamond products to various markets. Sales have met expectations, and the company is optimistic about its performance in the fourth quarter.

Lastly, AI technologies are increasingly being integrated into healthcare, with potential implications for patient privacy. Companies are using AI to manage patient data, create care summaries, and monitor patient-therapist interactions for mental health signals. However, concerns exist regarding data accuracy, biases, and the lack of oversight and standardization in informing patients about AI use.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, and have a great day ahead! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
