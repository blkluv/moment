### Transcript

Good day everyone, this is Erika and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this beautiful day of February 15, 2024. Let's delve into some of the headlines making waves today.

First up, we have a rather poignant story. Parents of children who were tragically killed in shootings have found a unique way to keep their memory alive. They've used artificial intelligence to recreate the voices of their children and are using these AI-generated messages to advocate for gun safety and control. The campaign, led by Patricia and Manny Oliver, parents of Parkland school shooting victim Joaquin Oliver, aims to address gun violence in the United States. This initiative has raised ethical questions about the use of deepfakes and the recreation of voices of the deceased, but the parents involved believe their children would have supported the cause against gun violence.

On the entertainment front, Apple TV+ has released a new series called 'The New Look', which delves into the lives and rivalry of Christian Dior and Coco Chanel in post-World War II France. Despite its rich production and the allure of famous names in fashion, the show is more a study of character than a lesson in art or history.

In sports news, The South African Rugby Union has announced its intention to sell a 20% stake in its commercial ventures to Ackerley Sports Group. This decision has sparked tension within South African rugby, with major unions feeling sidelined and raising concerns about the strategic and financial implications of the deal.

As for golf, the contentious issue of how players who embraced the LIV Golf League might return to the US PGA Tour remains under "daily" discussion, according to superstar Tiger Woods.

In tech news, Amazon researchers have developed the largest text-to-speech model to date, showcasing emergent abilities that enhance its natural speech capabilities. However, the team has withheld the model's source to prevent misuse by bad actors.

In a surprising development, startup WindBorne Systems has made significant strides in the field of artificial intelligence for weather prediction, surpassing industry giants such as Huawei, Nvidia, and Google DeepMind.

Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi's announcement of the activation of 6,945 "new" CCTV cameras in Gauteng has been revealed to be misleading. The majority of these cameras were already deployed by private entities, contradicting the presentation of the cameras as a new government-led project.

Lastly, MTN has initiated a transformative solar renewable energy project at its 14th Avenue head office in Johannesburg, marking a significant step towards sustainable energy use and operational independence.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Stay safe and have a great day!
