### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is August 24, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have an exclusive story about Mediclinic launching a probe following allegations of bill manipulation. A whistleblower, claiming to be a former manager, has accused the hospital group of manipulating patient bills to save money. The whistleblower alleges that at least four hospitals manipulated coding and death classifications to benefit financially. Additionally, employees who spoke out against these practices were allegedly victimized. Mediclinic has expressed confidence in their billing processes but has pledged to take decisive action if the accusations are proven true.

In other news, a private aircraft crashed north of Moscow with no survivors. Russian authorities listed Yevgeny Prigozhin, a notable Russian mercenary chief, as a passenger on the plane, but this has not been confirmed by Reuters or other sources. Prigozhin recently led a mutiny against Russia's top army officials, which ultimately ended in negotiations. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation.

Moving on, engineers at RMIT University in Australia have developed a method to strengthen concrete using waste coffee grounds. By converting the coffee grounds into biochar through a low-energy process, the researchers were able to strengthen concrete by 30%. This technique not only helps reduce the amount of coffee waste that ends up in landfills but also preserves natural sand resources. The team plans to collaborate with industries for practical implementation and field trials.

Next, we have an interesting construction project in Cape Town. The world's tallest hemp building, a 12-storey structure, is nearing completion. Made of hempcrete, the building took over three and a half years to construct and cost around R180 million. It will house the Hemporium flagship store, a restaurant, and an apart-hotel with 50 units. Hempcrete offers qualities such as soundproofing, thermal insulation, and carbon-absorbing properties. The construction signifies the potential importance of the hemp industry in South Africa, providing sustainable and greener options.

Now, let's talk about South Africa's oldest World Masters rower, John Price. At 93 years old, Price will be part of South Africa's team for the World Rowing Masters Regatta next month. The regatta will take place at Roodeplaat Dam, which has undergone significant transformations to become a world-class course. Price recalls the time when the facility had only a single boathouse and rowers had to navigate through reeds. The regatta will see around 900 competitors, with about 70% of them being international. Roodeplaat Dam has played a crucial role in South African rowing and has been associated with the country's Olympic rowing medals.

Lastly, India has successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 mission on the moon's unexplored south pole. This achievement makes India the fourth nation to land on the moon and the first to touch down on a lunar pole. The mission's success is significant as the lunar south pole has shown potential for water ice, which could be essential for future exploration. This success follows India's previous unsuccessful attempt with Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. The mission's cost was estimated at $75 million, and it has been celebrated worldwide, including a congratulatory message from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.

That's all for today's news stories. Stay informed, and have a great day ahead! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
