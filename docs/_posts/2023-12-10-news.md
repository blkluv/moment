Good day, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is December 10, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani has made headlines by signing a record-breaking $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani, who has been compared to Babe Ruth for his ability to hit home runs and pitch, announced the signing on Instagram. His unique talent as both a starting pitcher and a power hitter has made him an iconic figure in the world of baseball. Despite recovering from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani's value to the Dodgers as a hitter is estimated to be worth $35 million to $40 million this season alone. Additionally, it is predicted that Ohtani could bring in an additional $20 million per year in off-the-field value through merchandise, ticketing, and sponsorships.

Moving on, billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has argued that products from YouTube stars like MrBeast and Logan Paul represent the future of consumer-product relationships. Andreessen believes that influencer/creator-branded products, such as Feastables snacks and Prime energy drinks, could be the way forward in the consumer market. He points out that historically, brands like Coca-Cola and Kraft Mac & Cheese were built through traditional media, but the rise of social media influencers has shifted consumer preferences. Andreessen suggests that the future of consumer products may be individually-led brands, rather than conglomerates.

In other news, residents in Gauteng, South Africa, are being urged to reduce their water usage due to supply challenges. Tshwane and Johannesburg are facing water shortages as a result of high consumption rates and dwindling reservoir levels. The increased demand, coupled with hot weather, has led to water shortages in several areas. Officials are deploying water tankers to affected areas and are calling on residents to conserve water to avoid further outages.

Next, Eddie Jones is set to return as Japan's head coach for the national rugby team. Jones previously held the position from 2012 to 2015 and is expected to be confirmed in the role following interviews with the Japanese Rugby Football Union. Chris Webb, a former Wallabies general manager, is also speculated to join Jones' team in Japan. Jones' return to the Japan national team comes after his controversial tenure with the Wallabies, which ended due to disagreements with Rugby Australia. The official announcement of Jones' appointment is expected soon.

Shifting gears, the use of weight loss drugs and their potential impact on society is the focus of our next story. Lily Steiner, a Melbourne resident, experienced significant weight loss after taking Ozempic for her diabetes. While the drug has shown promise for weight loss, it is not universally effective or accessible due to side effects, costs, and shortages. The widespread use of effective weight loss drugs raises questions about public health, business, body image, and interpersonal relationships. The off-label use of Ozempic for obesity in Australia is currently a topic of debate, with implications for the pharmaceutical industry and related sectors.

In South Africa, businessman Roger Jardine has announced his presidential ambition and criticized the ANC for failing the country. Jardine proposes a new political platform called Change South Africa Now and aims to restore dignity and improve the quality of life for South Africans. He has met with leaders of the Democratic Alliance (DA) and is supported by financial backers who see him as a strong contender against President Cyril Ramaphosa. Jardine's platform focuses on addressing the ANC's governance failures and collaborating with like-minded parties and civil society for change. However, some question his struggle credentials and view his initiative as right-wing.

Lastly, the Blitzboks, South Africa's rugby sevens team, suffered a defeat to Ireland in the Cape Town Sevens pool finale. Despite a late comeback attempt, the Blitzboks lost 14-12 to Ireland, ending their undefeated run this season. They will now face Australia in the quarter-finals, while Ireland will face the 11-time Cape Town Sevens champions, New Zealand.

That's all for today's headlines. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
