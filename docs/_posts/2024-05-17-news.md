### Transcript

Hello, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', and today's date is May 17, 2024. Let's dive into some of the latest news stories making headlines today.

First up, we're looking into a major financial scandal in South Africa. Mirror Trading International, known as MTI, was once the country's largest pyramid scheme, which promised ten percent monthly returns and bonuses for recruiting new members. The scheme began in 2019 but came to a crashing halt in December 2020 when CEO Johann Steynberg vanished in Brazil. With estimates suggesting that investors were defrauded out of between fourteen point seven billion to thirty-five point three billion Rand, the fallout has been global. Liquidators are now seeking repayments from anyone who withdrew funds from MTI, and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has imposed a staggering three point five billion dollar penalty on Steynberg. Despite reports of Steynberg's death, the situation surrounding other key figures involved remains filled with uncertainties, including potential criminal charges and civil penalties.

Switching gears to the world of e-sports in South Africa, it's been a lucrative field for players. South African e-sports enthusiasts have collectively earned thirty-six point five million Rand across five hundred ten tournaments. The industry has seen a growth rate of seven point one percent annually and is projected to reach seventy-nine billion Rand globally by the end of 2024. Among these gamers, Ioannis “JT” Theodosiou stands out with earnings of three point seven million Rand from one hundred seven tournaments, mainly from playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Now, let's talk about a breathtaking achievement in the Himalayas. The Madswimmer Team, led by founder Jean Craven, recently set a record for the highest-altitude swim at six thousand four hundred and five meters on Mt. Putha Hiunchuli. Their fifteen-day expedition was not just about breaking records; it also highlighted the impact of climate change on high-altitude regions and supported charitable causes through their BackaBuddy campaign, raising twenty-four thousand two hundred Rand.

In Egypt, researchers have made an intriguing discovery regarding the ancient Nile's geography. They've mapped a long-lost arm of the Nile, the Ahramat Branch, which was crucial for transporting materials and laborers for pyramid construction. This branch, now dried up, was about half a kilometer wide and twenty-five meters deep, playing a significant role in the alignment of pyramids and ceremonial causeways.

Over in the world of sports broadcasting, SuperSport is introducing an innovative feature called SuperScreen. Starting May 19, 2024, viewers in South Africa can watch all ten matches of the final Premier League season simultaneously on one channel, DStv Channel 199. This feature will also cover the final match day of the DStv Premiership season and will be a part of the Paris Olympic Games coverage.

Lastly, a note on Monday Night Football's final episode of the season, which highlighted the show's reliance on detailed statistical analysis. Presenter David Jones, along with pundits Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville, delved into various football strategies and player performances, driven by data provided by Sky Sports’ stats team. This approach has shaped how viewers understand the game, offering a deeper insight into football tactics.

That's all for today's news roundup on 'Just a Moment News'. I'm Erika, and I hope you found these stories enlightening. Thank you for tuning in, and we'll catch you next time on 'Just a Moment News'.
