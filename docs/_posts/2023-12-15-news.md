Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' bringing you the latest updates on this 15th day of December, 2023. Let's dive right into today's stories.

Starting off with sports, India has made a victorious comeback in the third T20I against South Africa, leveling the series with a 106-run win. The match, held at the Wanderers, saw Suryakumar Yadav hitting a spectacular century, while Yashasvi Jaiswal added 60 runs to India's total of 201 for 7. Kuldeep Yadav, celebrating his birthday, made it even more memorable by claiming a personal best of 5 wickets for 17 runs, effectively dismantling South Africa's batting line-up. Despite some notable moments, including Keshav Maharaj's economic bowling and David Miller's 35 runs, South Africa ended with 95 all out, marking their third largest T20I defeat while batting second.

Now, let's move to eThekwini Metro, where the Moses Mabhida Stadium is reportedly running at a significant deficit of R228 million for the year ending June 2023. ActionSA councillor Alan Beesley raised concerns about this financial distress, but Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda disputes the figure. The mayor argues that the stadium's operating and capital budget requirements are fully funded by eThekwini, and its generated revenue contributes to the city's income. The municipality assures that the stadium is fully operational, compliant with legislation, and not on the brink of collapse.

Next, we have some eerie predictions for the new year from Nostradamus and Baba Vanga, two famous prophets known for their foreboding predictions about the future. For 2024, Baba Vanga foresees a technological revolution driven by advancements in AI and quantum computing, as well as significant threats from cyberattacks. She also predicts breakthroughs in medical sciences, including the discovery of cures for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Nostradamus, on the other hand, speculates about changes in the British monarchy and ongoing environmental crises. However, it's worth noting that these predictions are often met with skepticism and are typically viewed with caution.

Let's talk about Netflix now. The streaming giant recently released data for the first half of 2023, providing a comprehensive look into user engagement. The data shows diversity in the top titles, with 60% of the top 25 shows featuring people of color in lead roles. It also revealed that about 21% of titles had minimal engagement, with 'Making the Witcher: Blood Origin' being the least watched among Netflix originals. It's fascinating to see the sheer volume of content on Netflix and the diverse viewer preferences.

In the world of UFC, Leon Edwards will defend his welterweight championship against Colby Covington in the main event of UFC 296 on Saturday. The other title bout features Alexandre Pantoja making the first defense of his flyweight belt against Brandon Royval. ESPN's Marc Raimondi spoke to UFC welterweight Belal Muhammad and former two-time men's flyweight champion Brandon Moreno for their insights on the title fights.

Virgin Active is introducing a cool new feature in its gyms - ice baths. Starting with a successful pilot at the Silos club in Cape Town, these ice baths are planned for expansion, marking Virgin Active's evolution into a "social wellness club." CEO Dean Kowarski emphasizes the benefits of ice baths for physical recovery and mental well-being, aligning with the gym's shift towards overall wellness.

Finally, MrBeast, the top YouTuber in the U.S., co-founded a new analytics platform called ViewStats, which is now available in beta. Similar to Social Blade, ViewStats uses the YouTube API to unveil detailed stats about channels that both creators and their fans can see. The platform is set to add more tools in the future, including thumbnail analytics tools.

That wraps up our news for today. This has been Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest updates from around the world. Stay tuned for more, and have a great day!
