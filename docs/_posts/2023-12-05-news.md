Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is December 5th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

Our first story revolves around the new Apple TV+ documentary, "John Lennon: Murder Without a Trial." The documentary reveals previously unheard confessions of John Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman. Chapman, under hypnosis, described in disturbing detail his assassination of Lennon, influenced by a voice in his head. The film also explores Chapman's obsession with the novel "The Catcher in the Rye" and his confession behind bars, where he admitted to killing Lennon for being "a phony." Witnesses recount Lennon's final moments, and the documentary delves into Chapman's psychological state and rationale behind the murder. It concludes with reflections on Lennon's optimism and the lasting impact of his murder, leaving a mystery about the whereabouts of his ashes.

Moving on to our next story, the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI trailer confirms several elements suggested by leaked footage. The trailer reveals that the game is set in Vice City, the fictionalized Miami, and introduces the first female protagonist in a Bonnie-and-Clyde-type duo. It maintains Rockstar's satirical portrayal of American culture and showcases various elements of the city's lifestyle, including beaches, architecture, and social media trends. Notably, this is the first major title from Rockstar Games developed without Dan Houser. The trailer was released after a leaked version appeared on a suspended account, causing an unexpected rush.

In a heartwarming story, around 50 bystanders in Port Edward, South Africa, formed a human chain to save a man from drowning. The NSRI Port Edward rescue team, along with local emergency services, responded to the incident, but it was the collective effort of the community that played a pivotal role in the rescue. Two locals, along with a former lifeguard, used NSRI pink rescue buoys to keep the drowning man afloat. This incident highlights the solidarity and commitment to helping others within the Port Edward community.

Next, we have news from South Africa's political scene. The Sheriff of the Gauteng High Court raided the ANC's Luthuli House headquarters in search of assets. Events company Ezulweni Investments attached the party's accounts and physical assets to recover over R100 million owed for work done during the 2019 elections campaign. While assets have not yet been removed from the building, the Sheriff catalogued items such as desks, chairs, laptops, TVs, and couches. Ezulweni Investments expressed disappointment in the ANC's lack of payment and accused them of undermining the justice system.

In a milestone achievement, comedian Trevor Noah has been named the recipient of the 2023 Erasmus Prize. He visited the Netherlands to accept the prize, becoming the first comedian in 60 years and the first South African to receive this prestigious award. Noah's political comedy, known for its sharp-minded and inclusive satire, aligns with the theme of the prize, 'In Praise of Folly,' inspired by Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus. The Erasmus Prize is awarded annually to individuals or institutions that have made exceptional contributions to the humanities, social sciences, or arts.

Lastly, we have news from the tech industry. Spotify has announced a reduction in its total headcount by around 17% across the company. This decision comes after the company laid off 6% of its staff earlier this year due to higher costs. Despite a positive earnings report and growth in subscribers, Spotify's CEO, Daniel Ek, decided that a substantial action to right-size costs was necessary to achieve their financial goals.

And that wraps up today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
