Hello everyone, this is Erika with 'Just a Moment News' and today is the 13th of February, 2024. Let's dive right into the news stories of the day.

Firstly, Cape Town's property market is experiencing a significant boost, thanks to a surge in South African expats returning home. It seems that the favorable exchange rates and the pursuit of a better lifestyle are driving this trend. Real estate agents from Lew Geffen Sotheby’s International Realty are noting that these returnees, often in their thirties and forties, are leveraging their foreign-earned currencies to invest in Cape Town's luxury property market. Interestingly, this shift is reflective of a broader pattern of semigration within South Africa and growing interest from high-net-worth foreign investors.

In the realm of renewable energy, a novel approach by Minesto's Dragon 12 is making waves. Unlike conventional tidal turbines, Minesto's technology utilizes underwater kites, which emulate the dynamic flight patterns of air-based wind kites. The Dragon 12, installed in the Faroe Islands, has successfully been connected to the local grid, marking a significant milestone for Minesto. This deployment showcases the potential of tidal energy in providing reliable, cost-effective, and predictable renewable energy.

Moving on to sports, Sunday night’s Super Bowl shattered ratings records. An audience of 123.4 million watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers, according to preliminary figures from Nielsen and CBS. The vast majority watched the game on CBS, which recorded 120 million viewers. The game had a lot going for it, including a game-winning touchdown pass and a superstar quarterback, Patrick Mahomes.

In supermarket news, Woolworths has notably shifted towards cashless transactions at its supermarkets and WCafe outlets. The transition towards fewer cash transactions reflects a broader trend of decreasing cash usage. Woolworths' strategy is less about reducing cash handling costs and more about enhancing in-store security by minimizing the cash float required at each till.

In the world of sports apparel, Tiger Woods, following a split with Nike, has collaborated with TaylorMade to launch a new lifestyle brand named "Sun Day Red." The partnership signifies Woods's direct contribution to the design of the Sun Day Red products and TaylorMade's expansion into the clothing industry.

Over in Cape Town, the city has announced an innovative plan to buy excess solar power from residential households. This initiative comes as a response to the frequent blackouts experienced across the country. The city's strategy aims to incorporate up to one gigawatt of independently produced electricity over time.

Finally, in the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has experienced a significant resurgence, trading around fifty thousand dollars after breaching this key level for the first time in over two years. The recent rally is attributed to the optimism surrounding the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last month, signaling a shift towards mainstream acceptance.

And that wraps up our news for today. This is Erika with 'Just a Moment News', signing off. Stay informed and have a great day.
