Starting with a win in the entertainment industry, Trevor Noah's "The Daily Show" has bagged its first Emmy for Best Variety Talk Show since Jon Stewart's time. This win comes as a sweet ending to Noah's final season, which had been delayed due to Hollywood strikes. Noah humorously acknowledged their triumph over John Oliver in his acceptance speech and expressed gratitude towards his team. As of now, a successor for Noah as host of "The Daily Show" is yet to be found.

In other Emmy news, the restaurant-themed series 'The Bear' has swept the comedy honors. Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Ededbiri, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach won best actor, supporting actress, and actor respectively. The series also won directing and writing honors and was in the running for best comedy series. The ceremony was marked by several poignant moments, including an emotional acceptance speech by Quinta Brunson, who won best actress in a comedy for her role in "Abbott Elementary."

Moving on to the tech world, Microsoft has launched Copilot Pro, a subscription service offering AI-enhanced Office features to consumers.

In the sports arena, 16-year-old Lara Markthaler is representing South Africa at the Youth Winter Olympics in South Korea.

In business news, Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. CEO James Dolan has decided to abandon a major project to construct a Sphere entertainment venue in East London, following an unexpected veto from London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Despite five years of planning and a significant initial investment, Dolan has opted to withdraw from the project and sell the land, citing political reasons.

In tennis, Naomi Osaka's return to Grand Slam tennis at the Australian Open ended in a defeat against Caroline Garcia. Her comeback, along with those of several other players, highlights the challenges of returning to professional tennis after a long break. Despite the setbacks, players like Osaka are maintaining a positive outlook and focusing on future goals.
