### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the top stories for today, January 26, 2024.

Let's dive right in. Our first story touches on a concerning incident involving AI-generated explicit images of singer Taylor Swift, which found their way onto Twitter. These images originated from a Telegram group that focuses on creating abusive AI images of women. The group used Microsoft's AI image generator, exploiting loopholes to bypass content filters. Despite efforts by Swift's fans to suppress the images with "protect Taylor Swift" tweets, many images still remained on Twitter. This incident underscores the challenges of moderating AI-generated content and raises concerns about the ethics and control of AI technologies.

Moving on to wildlife news, the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya is experiencing a surge in tourist activity, which is impacting its ecosystem. The influx of tourists is leading to overcrowded viewing spots and changes in wildlife behavior. In response, officials are implementing measures such as developing a safari crowd-control app, rethinking marketing strategies, increasing entry fees, and establishing a cheetah anti-harassment unit.

In automotive news, Toyota is set to introduce its first hybrid powertrains in South Africa for the Hilux bakkie and Fortuner SUV in March 2024. The new 48V mild hybrid system pairs with the 2.8-litre turbo diesel engine, offering enhanced throttle response and acceleration in urban settings.

In tech news, Apple has released the first developer beta of iOS 17.4 and has introduced auto-generated transcripts for the Apple Podcasts app. Additionally, Apple is now allowing alternative browser engines to run on iOS for users in the EU, marking a significant shift in its mobile operating system.

Fubo, a live TV streaming service, has introduced a new feature that provides instant headlines from live news programs, allowing users to receive highlights from various top news networks without watching the entire program.

Meanwhile, the Africa Solar Industry Association reports that solar energy in Africa, particularly in South Africa, is growing at an astonishing rate, with over 3.7GWp of new solar installations in 2023.

Netflix fans will be thrilled to hear that the release date for season six of "Formula 1: Drive to Survive" has been set for February 23, just in time for the final day of F1 pre-season testing in Bahrain.

Finally, in archaeological news, recent discoveries in the Ecuadorean Amazon have uncovered a vast network of ancient cities that date back 2,500 years, challenging previous understandings of the region's history.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to 'Just a Moment News'. This is Erika, signing off. Have a great day!
