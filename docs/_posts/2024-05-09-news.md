Hello everyone, welcome to 'Just a Moment News.' I’m your host, Erika, and today, May 9th, 2024, we’re diving into some intriguing headlines from around the globe.

Starting off, we have an interesting turn of events with FlySafair, a South African airline. During their annual birthday sale, which featured tickets for as low as ten Rand, a vulnerability was found on their website. Charl Kruger, an Investec web platform owner, discovered a method to bypass the randomized waiting room selection using some clever maneuvers with Chrome's developer tools. Despite his attempts to alert FlySafair through social media, which were initially ignored, the issue was later addressed by the airline. Kirby Gordon, the chief marketing officer, acknowledged the flaw and assured that measures were put in place to rectify it promptly.

Switching gears, let’s talk about Fiona Harvey, the real-life inspiration behind the character Martha in the Netflix series "Baby Reindeer." Harvey has expressed her dissatisfaction with how she was portrayed in the series, leading her to reveal her identity in a The Daily Record article. She plans to set the record straight in an upcoming interview with Piers Morgan on YouTube and is considering legal action against Netflix and the series creator, Richard Gadd.

In tech news, Microsoft has taken a significant step in securing AI technology by deploying a GPT-4 large language model in an air-gapped environment within the Azure Government Top Secret cloud. Announced by William Chappell, the CTO of Microsoft's Strategic Missions and Technology, this setup is designed to enhance security for sensitive government operations, marking a notable advancement in AI deployment.

Moving to green energy, a group of University of Cape Town graduates, who founded the renewable energy startup Omnivat, have made headlines. They secured the runner-up position in the Milken-Motsepe Prize in Green Energy, bagging a substantial prize. Their innovation focuses on a power system that combines solar panels, batteries, and hydrogen, and is housed in a shipping container. This system not only provides energy but also doubles as a shaded marketplace, targeting rural and peri-urban areas.

In entertainment, Ster-Kinekor, a major South African cinema chain, is bringing nostalgia back to the big screen with their Throwback Cinema initiative. They’re showing timeless classics like Chicago, Meet Joe Black, and others, at a reduced ticket price. This move comes as the company faces economic challenges, including job cuts and the closure of some theaters.

Lastly, a significant development in theme park entertainment, Disneyland has received the final approval from the Anaheim city council for a major expansion plan known as "DisneylandForward." This project aims to enhance the guest experience by transforming existing parking lots into new attractions and thematic lands, potentially increasing visitor numbers significantly over the next two decades.

That’s all for today’s discussion on 'Just a Moment News.' Thanks for tuning in. I’m Erika, and I hope you found these insights intriguing. Stay curious, and keep exploring the stories around you. Until next time!
