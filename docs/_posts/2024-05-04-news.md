### Transcript

Hello everyone, welcome to 'Just a Moment News' with your host, Erika. Today is May 4, 2024, and we have an interesting lineup of news stories to discuss.

Starting off, Comsol, a South African connectivity provider, has announced its ambitious plan to roll out a national 5G network over the next year. This development builds on their existing millimeter-wave fixed wireless access network. They launched their 5G FWA service in Gauteng’s business districts just this past March, offering speed tiers up to 100 Mbps. Comsol’s strategy focuses on business clients, aiming to add around four hundred thousand new customers by offering competitively priced products. They're also ensuring service reliability against power cuts up to stage eight load-shedding, which is quite significant.

Moving on to the aviation sector, FlySafair, a major South African airline, is exploring the potential of integrating Starlink’s satellite internet service to offer in-flight Wi-Fi. This could be a game changer as traditional satellite services have been too slow and expensive. However, FlySafair is currently navigating through some regulatory challenges with the South African authorities and needs equipment certifications for common aircraft like the Boeing 737. They aim to have everything in place by the end of 2024.

In the world of music and culture, the Cape Town International Jazz Festival has just kicked off its 21st event with a significant boost. The Survé family has donated a whopping one hundred million Rand to support the festival for the next three years. This substantial contribution is part of a larger effort to support arts and education in South Africa. The festival features a mix of local and international jazz talents and is a key cultural event for Cape Town.

In tech news, X, previously known as Twitter, has introduced a new feature called Stories on X, which utilizes Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, to summarize trending stories for its premium users. This marks a shift in how social media platforms might use AI to enhance user experiences, though it does raise questions about the potential for misinformation and the impact on traditional news outlets.

Switching gears to sports, Carlos Sainz, the Formula One driver, has had quite a year. After being told by Ferrari that this would be his last season with them, he went on to win the Australian Grand Prix, making a statement on the track. His future in F1 is still up in the air, but his resilience and skill are clear.

In the realm of sports broadcasting, Sky Sports has inked a new deal worth £935 million with the English Football League, which will see the replacement of the iFollow streaming service in the UK. While this deal promises more live matches and broader coverage, it also ends domestic streaming, prompting some clubs to consider launching their own TV stations for international audiences.

Lastly, Ukraine has introduced an AI-generated digital spokesperson for its foreign ministry. Named Victoria Shi, this digital persona will deliver official statements, with human staff continuing to write and verify the content. This innovative approach aims to streamline communications and save resources amid ongoing challenges in Ukraine.

That wraps up our discussion for today here at 'Just a Moment News.' Thank you for tuning in, and we hope you found these insights interesting. I'm Erika, and we'll be back with more news and discussions soon. Stay informed and take care!
