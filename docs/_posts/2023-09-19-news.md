### Transcript

Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is September 19, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, Elon Musk, during a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the possibility of converting his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) into a paid-only model. This move is aimed at combating hate speech and bot armies. Musk cited the challenges of policing millions of daily posts but expressed a willingness to "deamplify" hate content. The conversation took place during Netanyahu's visit to Silicon Valley, where he aimed to promote Israel's AI capabilities and attract investment. Discussions also touched on privacy issues in AI and concerns over its impact on democracy and society.

In other news, an F-35B stealth jet has gone missing over South Carolina after the pilot safely ejected. The search efforts are concentrated around two lakes north of Charleston. The F-35's stealth capabilities have complicated the search as its transponder was not working. Joint Base Charleston is currently investigating the incident. This event brings to mind a similar incident in 1989 when a Soviet MiG-23 continued flying after the pilot ejected, eventually crashing in Belgium. This adds to the history of previous crashes involving the F-35.

Moving on to entertainment news, Netflix's new crime thriller "Reptile" has received mixed reviews. Led by Benicio del Toro and featuring Justin Timberlake and Alicia Silverstone, the film falls short of comparable works by directors like David Fincher, according to critics. Directed by Grant Singer, primarily known for his music videos, the movie follows a New England detective investigating a high-profile murder. While the film's visual style has been commended, its performances and narrative have been criticized as derivative and lacking depth. Benicio del Toro's acting is noted as a highlight, but Justin Timberlake and Alicia Silverstone's contributions are considered less-than-stellar.

In local news, Johannesburg is facing a critical water shortage, putting its water reticulation system under strain. High consumption by residents is attributed to the issue, with warnings that the system could collapse if the trend continues. Some areas have shown slight improvement, but water levels remain critically low in numerous neighborhoods and reservoirs. This crisis has also impacted healthcare facilities, such as Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa Mother and Child hospitals, which are at risk of increased infection spread and surgery backlogs. Residents are urgently asked to reduce water consumption to mitigate the situation.

Lastly, Rassie Erasmus, the Director of Rugby for the Springboks, has ruled out a potential move to Ireland. Speculation arose due to the upcoming vacancy for Irish Rugby's performance director in 2024. However, Erasmus stated that he has no intention of following Springboks head coach Jacques Nienaber, who will become Leinster's senior coach after the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Additionally, Erasmus confirmed that Handre Pollard will not play against Ireland in the upcoming World Cup match due to recent recovery from injury. Both teams have won their initial two games in the tournament.

That's all for today's headlines. Thank you for joining us on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
