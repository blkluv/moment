### Transcript

Hello, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today, on May 25, 2024, we're diving into some of the most interesting news stories from around the globe.

First up, let's talk rugby. The Sharks have ended a twenty-eight-year drought by clinching a European Professional Club Rugby title. They secured a 36-22 victory over Gloucester in London. Despite a challenging season in the United Rugby Championship, the Sharks excelled in the Challenge Cup, topping the pool stages and defeating teams like Zebre, Edinburgh, and Clermont on their way to the final. In the decisive match, players like Phendulani Buthelezi, Aphelele Fassi, and Makazole Mapimpi scored crucial tries, while Siya Masuku added twenty-one points with his kicking game. This win not only brings the trophy home but also secures their spot in next season's Champions Cup.

Switching gears to mixed martial arts, UFC middleweight champion Dricus Du Plessis has big plans for his career. Currently holding a record of twenty-one wins and two losses, Du Plessis is eyeing a potential title defense against Israel Adesanya and, if possible, a future bout against Khamzat Chimaev. He's looking to solidify his legacy in the middleweight division before possibly moving up to light heavyweight. Du Plessis, a former double champion at EFC, is focused on proving his prowess in the UFC, with his eyes set on becoming a double champ in different weight classes.

Now, let's talk technology. Microsoft has made significant strides in AI with their new model, Phi-3-mini, which is efficient enough to run on devices like the MacBook Air. This development marks a shift towards more compact AI models that maintain high performance without the need for massive datasets. The Phi-3-mini, comparable in capabilities to GPT-3.5, could pave the way for AI to be more deeply integrated into personal devices, potentially enhancing user experiences with reduced latency and increased privacy.

In entertainment news, Netflix has released their latest viewing figures. The film "Leave the World Behind" topped their charts with one hundred and twenty-one million views, while "One Piece" led the TV category with seventy-two million views. This data comes from Netflix's comprehensive engagement report, which now includes detailed metrics like runtime and views, offering insights into what content is capturing global audiences.

Lastly, a bit of a nostalgic discovery in the world of historical artifacts. The USS Harder, a World War II submarine known for its significant impact against Japanese forces, has been found off the coast of Luzon, Philippines. This submarine, which had been missing for over eighty years, played a crucial role during the war and is now a war grave, honoring the memory of the seventy-nine sailors who perished.

That wraps up our news roundup for today. I'm Erika from Just a Moment News. Thank you for tuning in, and we'll catch up on more stories soon.
