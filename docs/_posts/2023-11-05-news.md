Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for November 5, 2023. Let's dive right in.

In sports news, the Proteas have secured their spot in the Cricket World Cup semi-finals. Pakistan defeated New Zealand by 21 runs in a thrilling match, thanks to Fakhar Zaman's explosive century. South Africa's advancement to the semi-finals is now confirmed. Pakistan's chances of reaching the semi-finals depend on their final game against England and New Zealand's result against Sri Lanka.

Moving on to tech news, xAI has introduced Grok, an AI that can respond with wit and suggest questions to users. Grok has access to real-time global knowledge and is currently in the early beta stage. It has shown exceptional performance on benchmarks, outpacing similar models in efficiency. xAI is dedicated to reliable infrastructure and is exploring ways to incorporate human-like senses and robustness against adversarial attacks. Those in the US can join the Grok waitlist for early access.

Shifting gears to the world of bodybuilding, Derek Lunsford has won the 2023 Mr. Olympia title. After placing second in 2022, Lunsford triumphed over Hadi Choopan, the previous year's champion. Mamdouh "Big Ramy" Elssbiay, the 2020 and 2021 Mr. Olympia, did not participate in this competition. Lunsford made history by becoming the first to win Olympia titles in multiple divisions, earning a significant prize of $400,000.

Now, let's talk about a surprising familial connection in the tech industry. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, are distant relatives with roots in Taiwan. Despite their blood ties, they did not grow up together, allowing for a professional rivalry in the competitive AI chip industry. Both leaders share a commitment to semiconductor technology and have had overlapping career paths. They continue to push the boundaries of their influence in the tech world, despite growing geopolitical tensions affecting the chip market.

In local news, the Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District Municipality in the North West has been involved in a scandal. They paid a staggering 38 million rand for a prefabricated call centre and are renting equipment for 1.4 million rand monthly. The tender was won by Wcyber Solutions, which is connected to a municipal official. Exorbitant prices for standard equipment and accusations of corruption and financial misconduct have been raised. The municipal manager claims that the expenditures are within legal requirements.

Lastly, in the world of professional wrestling, Logan Paul has won the U.S. title at WWE Crown Jewel. After calling out Rey Mysterio for a shot at the title, Paul defeated him using brass knuckles. This victory marks Paul's first championship in the pro-wrestling world. It is unclear how active Paul will be in WWE moving forward, but winning the U.S. title suggests he may make more appearances in the future.

That's it for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
