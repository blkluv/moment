### Transcript

Good day everyone! This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' bringing you the most intriguing stories of today, December 12, 2023.

Let's dive straight into the world of entertainment with the 2024 Golden Globes nominations. This year, the awards have taken a new turn with a restructured membership and a significant broadcast deal with CBS. The nominations seem to align more with Oscar front-runners and popular TV shows, leading to fewer unexpected choices and snubs. However, there were a few surprises, such as the nomination of Gary Oldman for "Slow Horses" and the controversial inclusion of "Past Lives" in the Best Non-English-Language Film category. It seems the Globes are adopting a more respectable and thoughtful approach, potentially ending the award's historically chaotic and unpredictable nature.

Moving on to political news, the Zulu royal throne seems to be on shaky grounds. The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria found that President Cyril Ramaphosa failed to follow due process to recognize Misuzulu KaZwelithini as King. The judgment was delivered by Judge Norman Davis, who criticized Ramaphosa for failing to comply with the Traditional and Khoisan Act. This case has stirred quite a controversy and it remains to be seen how it will unfold.

On a global scale, Google's 2023 Year in Search revealed the most trending topics worldwide. The war in Israel and Gaza topped the list, followed by the Titan submersible implosion and earthquakes in Turkey. On a lighter note, the report also highlighted popular searches in entertainment and culture, reflecting a fascinating blend of serious news and pop culture.

In sports news, Shohei Ohtani has signed a shocking contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He will receive just $2 million annually, deferring $68 million each year to be paid from 2034 to 2043. Ohtani proposed this deal structure to help the Dodgers financially support a strong team. With Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers are now the favorites to win the 2024 World Series.

In tech news, Vodacom has launched "PowerFlex," a new promotional product range offering customers customizable data plans with unlimited voice minutes and SMS. This appears to be a strategic response to similar plans by MTN and Melon Mobile, offering competitive pricing and the convenience of month-to-month payment.

Meanwhile, DStv, a MultiChoice-owned broadcaster, has enhanced its "Add Indian" bundle to now include full access to SuperSport Cricket. This new bundle could particularly appeal to cricket enthusiasts, given the upcoming cricket matches between South Africa and India, and South Africa's test matches against New Zealand.

In the food and beverage industry, Kauai, a quick-service restaurant known for its health-focused menu, has opened its 200th store in South Africa at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. Kauai's global expansion includes markets like the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Thailand, Namibia, Botswana, and plans for Australia.

Finally, in the world of science, researchers have made a breakthrough in understanding whale language. They have identified previously unknown elements of whale vocalizations that may be analogous to human speech. This discovery could mean that the communication of sperm whales is much more complex and can carry more information than previously thought.

That's all for today's roundup. I'm Erika from 'Just a Moment News' wishing you a wonderful day ahead. Stay tuned for more news tomorrow.
