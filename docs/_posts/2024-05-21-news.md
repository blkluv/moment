### Transcript

Hello everyone, welcome to 'Just a Moment News.' I'm Erika, and today is May 21, 2024. We have several interesting news stories to discuss today, so let's dive right in.

First up, Microsoft recently held a special event before their Build 2024 conference, where they announced some significant updates. They introduced the Copilot Plus PCs, featuring Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Plus processors, which will also include future Intel and AMD chips. These devices, from brands like Lenovo, Dell, Acer, Asus, and HP, are designed to harness AI features in Windows 11, boasting a fifty-eight percent speed increase over the M3 MacBook Air. The Surface lineup saw updates too, with the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop sporting AI-ready processors and improved performance. Additionally, partnerships with Adobe and other software providers will bring optimized AI applications to these new devices.

In another story, actress Scarlett Johansson is in a dispute with OpenAI. She alleges that OpenAI created a voice for ChatGPT that mimics hers without her consent, despite her refusal to voice the system herself. OpenAI introduced a voice named Sky, which Johansson and others noted sounds eerily similar to her own. This has led to Johansson hiring legal counsel and demanding transparency from OpenAI on how the voice was created. OpenAI has paused using Sky's voice while addressing these concerns.

Moving on to streaming news, BritBox is shutting down its video streaming service in South Africa in August, just three years after its launch. This closure is part of a broader trend of global streaming services reducing their investments in the African market. BritBox SA, initially a joint venture between BBC Studios and ITV, launched in South Africa in August 2021. Earlier this year, BBC Studios took full ownership of BritBox, also discontinuing it as a standalone service in the UK. This shutdown highlights the ongoing trend of decreased investment in streaming services in South Africa and across Africa.

In a concerning environmental story, Kris Hansen, a scientist at 3M, faced significant challenges when she discovered PFOS, a fluorochemical used in many 3M products, in human blood. Despite her meticulous research indicating widespread contamination, she faced skepticism and scrutiny from her superiors, who suggested errors in her methods rather than accepting her results. Hansenâ€™s discovery led to internal conflict at 3M, and her role was eventually minimized. Her research contributed to 3M notifying the EPA about PFOS in blood samples, although the company downplayed its significance and did not disclose all the harmful effects found in earlier studies.

In technology, Apple recently addressed an issue where iPhone users reported that old, deleted photos were reappearing in their Photos app. Apple released a fix in the iOS 17.5.1 update, attributing the problem to database corruption. This incident highlights the complexities of digital data management and the myth of digital deletion, as true deletion of digital data remains elusive, with cloud storage adding layers of complexity to the process.

Lastly, Elvis Presley's iconic Graceland mansion is facing foreclosure, leading to a legal battle initiated by his granddaughter, Riley Keough. A notice from Shelby County Courthouse states that Graceland will be auctioned on May 23. Keough has filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of a 2018 Deed of Trust allegedly signed by Lisa Marie Presley, which secured a $3.8 million loan with Graceland as collateral. Keough claims the documents are forged, and her attorney has obtained a temporary restraining order to halt the auction.

That's all for today's podcast. I'm Erika from 'Just a Moment News.' Thank you for tuning in, and we'll catch up again soon with more news updates. Goodbye for now!
