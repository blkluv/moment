First up, a high school football game in Oklahoma took a tragic turn when a shooting occurred, leaving four people injured.

Lastly, a new study has shed light on the connection between sleeping patterns and wages. Researchers have found that people who naturally prefer staying up late, known as "evening chronotypes," exhibit poorer health behaviors such as smoking and less physical activity. These behaviors then negatively affect their wages. However, the study did not establish a direct causal relationship between being an evening chronotype and earning lower wages. The researchers are calling for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms that affect productivity and health outcomes in relation to chronotypes...
