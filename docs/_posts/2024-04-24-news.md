### Transcript

Hello, everyone! This is Erika, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News' on this beautiful day, the 24th of April, 2024. Let's dive into the top stories making the rounds today.

First up, we have a bit of boardroom drama unfolding at MultiChoice Group. The company announced the immediate departure of its chairman, Imtiaz Patel, a decision that came as a surprise, especially since we were told just a few weeks ago that Patel would remain to oversee a potential transaction with Groupe Canal+. This sudden change in leadership has raised some eyebrows, with concerns about the governance practices at MultiChoice. Despite stepping down, Patel isn't completely out of the picture, as he will continue to advise MultiChoice in a consultancy role.

In other news, former Olympian Oscar Pistorius was recently spotted in public for the first time since his release from prison. The once international celebrity, who served time for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, appeared noticeably thinner and has shaved his bushy gray beard. These days, Pistorius leads a much more subdued life, adhering to strict parole conditions that include no alcohol, drugs, or social media, and mandatory volunteer work at a local church.

Meanwhile, on the financial front, Spotify's stock is on the rise, climbing over fourteen percent following the company's announcement of a profitable first quarter. The company's CEO, Daniel Ek, highlighted Spotify's achievement in maintaining consistent profitability as it celebrates its eighteenth year. Interestingly, the company's expansion into audiobooks has reportedly increased user listening time significantly, which is a promising development for Spotify.

In tech news, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses now have multimodal AI, a feature that allows users to interact with AI in practical, everyday scenarios. The glasses, which are connected to a phone, minimize response times, making them particularly useful for identifying items during outdoor activities without the need to use a phone. While the AI feature isn't perfect, it does add to the overall utility of the glasses.

In the world of cinema, Quentin Tarantino's 10th film, "The Movie Critic," has been shelved, despite the anticipation and the involvement of A-list actors like Brad Pitt. Tarantino chose to cancel the project, driven by a flurry of new ideas and the desire to maintain a legacy by possibly ending his career on a high note. As he navigates his next move, the industry and his audience eagerly await the final act of his storied career.

In another significant tech development, Axon has launched "Draft One," a software that utilizes AI to transform the transcription of audio from body-worn cameras into written police reports. The software aims to free up law enforcement officers for more community-focused duties. However, it also faces criticism over potential issues such as reduced officer accountability and the perpetuation of biases within AI-generated reports.

Finally, let's talk about the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, a significant scientific endeavor that has transformed our understanding of the cosmos. The telescope has rapidly become a cornerstone of both South African and international astronomical research, providing unprecedented sensitivity and resolution that allow for detailed cosmic observations. Beyond its research impact, MeerKAT also fosters significant human capital development, promoting local employment and educational opportunities in astronomy.

That's all for today's news. I'm Erika, and you've been listening to 'Just a Moment News.' Stay informed and have a great day!
