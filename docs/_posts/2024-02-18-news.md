### Transcript

Hello, it's Erika here, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast for February 18, 2024. Let's jump right into today's top stories.

First up, we have a fascinating tale from Hollywood involving Johnny Depp and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he's often known. It seems Depp has formed an unexpected friendship with the Prince, thanks to an investment from the Red Sea Film Fund in Depp's upcoming film "Jeanne du Barry." This unlikely bromance has unfolded against the backdrop of Saudi Arabia's modernization efforts under MBS's Vision 2030 initiative. It's a complex narrative of cultural exchange, political intrigue, and personal redemption, and it's certainly challenging preconceptions about the kingdom.

Moving over to the world of sports, we have a new UFC featherweight champion. Ilia Topuria, hailing from Spain, has defeated Alexander Volkanovski with a second-round knockout at UFC 298. This victory marks Spain's first UFC title and continues Topuria's impressive seven-fight winning streak. Meanwhile, Volkanovski's loss ends his nearly seven-year reign and a 12-fight winning streak at featherweight. The event also saw Robert Whittaker's unanimous decision win over Paulo Costa and Merab Dvalishvili's victory over Henry Cejudo.

In the realm of cinema, Hollywood's 'bad guy' Arnold Vosloo is back in his native South Africa. After spending over three decades in the United States, Vosloo has returned to work in his native Afrikaans and contribute to the local film industry. From his early days in Alberton to his celebrated roles in international cinema, Vosloo's journey is a testament to his dedication to the craft of acting.

In sad news, South African cricket legend Mike Procter has passed away at the age of seventy-seven due to complications during surgery. Despite his career being cut short by South Africa's exclusion from international cricket due to apartheid policies, Procter made significant contributions to the sport, both on and off the field. His legacy is remembered fondly by the cricket community worldwide.

In a surprising turn of events, former President Donald Trump has entered the sneaker market. At Sneaker Con in Philadelphia, Trump introduced his $399 “Never Surrender High-Top Sneaker.” This move, which saw the sneakers selling out quickly, seems to be a strategic attempt to engage with a younger demographic and expand his political base.

In rugby news, the DHL Stormers secured a narrow victory over the Sharks in Durban, extending their winning streak against South African teams with a 25-21 win. The victory sets the stage for an exciting upcoming game against the Vodacom Bulls.

Finally, in boxing news, Sivenathi Nontshinga has regained the IBF light flyweight title by stopping Adrian Curiel in the tenth round during a match in Oaxaca, Mexico. This victory marks a significant comeback for Nontshinga and was one of the highlights in a night of intense boxing competition.

And that wraps up our news for today. Thank you for joining me, Erika, here on 'Just a Moment News'. Until next time, stay informed and take care.
