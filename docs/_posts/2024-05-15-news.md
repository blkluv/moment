### Transcript

Hello everyone, and welcome to the "Just a Moment News" podcast. I'm your host, Erika, and today, May 15th, 2024, we have several interesting news stories to discuss.

First up, Google has recently unveiled its latest AI development, "Project Astra," at the Google I/O conference. This new AI agent prototype is designed with video comprehension capabilities that rival those of OpenAI's GPT-4o. Project Astra can identify objects, provide creative alliterations, explain code, and even help locate misplaced items using the camera and microphone on a user's device. Google plans to integrate some of these features into its products like the Gemini app later this year. Alongside Project Astra, Google also introduced several AI-related updates, including an improved Gemini 1.5 Pro model and the Gemini 1.5 Flash, a faster and more cost-effective AI model. Additionally, new generative AI models for creating images, audio, and video, such as Imagen 3 and Google Veo, were showcased, now available to select creators in a private preview.

Moving on to South Africa, the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies' Digitech website, which cost seven hundred and forty-four thousand Rand, is reportedly still experiencing significant issues. The site, intended as a portal for locally developed digital products, remains sluggish and error-ridden despite a recent visual update to align more with the South African government's color scheme. This has sparked discussions about the effectiveness of the redesign and the overall functionality of the website.

In the realm of film, South African filmmaker Dane Dodds has captured the essence of the Karoo in his award-winning documentary, "!Aitsa | Life." The film, which delves into existential questions while focusing on the everyday lives of the Karoo's inhabitants, including the Khoisan people, contrasts modern scientific endeavors with traditional knowledge. It has been screened in over twenty countries and has won eight awards. Dodds hopes the film inspires curiosity and deeper connections to the land and its cultures.

Next, we have the Lekker Network, co-founded by Nic Latouf, which connects South Africans globally to support each other's ventures. This network aims to leverage shared heritage and connections to foster international business opportunities for South Africans. It highlights the success stories of South Africans abroad, like the creators of Paw Patrol and the founders of Moâ€™s Crib, and emphasizes the potential of South Africans to drive global business success.

In Cape Town, a mysterious 'Don't Panic' sign has appeared on Table Mountain, causing a stir among locals and sparking widespread speculation and concern on social media. Theories about the sign's origin range from alien messages to political campaigns. As of now, no individual or organization has claimed responsibility for the sign.

Lastly, Amazon Prime Video held its first upfront presentation to advertisers in New York, featuring major stars and showcasing its original series, films, and sports content. The event was star-studded and aimed to make a significant impact on advertisers and the marketplace, with announcements of new projects and renewals of popular series.

That's all for today's episode of "Just a Moment News." I'm Erika, and I hope you found our discussion informative. Join us next time for more news updates. Goodbye!
