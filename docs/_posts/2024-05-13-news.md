Hello, everyone! This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News,' bringing you some of the day's most interesting news stories on this 13th of May, 2024.

Starting off with the tech world, Google I/O 2024 is just around the corner, scheduled for May 14th. The event is set to kick off with a keynote at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. This year, the focus seems to be on artificial intelligence, enhancements to the Android operating system, and some exciting hardware reveals. Notably, Android 15 is expected to introduce AI-driven features like satellite messaging and improved tablet functionality. There’s also buzz around Google’s AI advancements, particularly the Gemini chatbot, and updates on devices like the Pixel Fold and Google Pixel Watch 3. The conference, which will also cover topics like Wear OS 5 and extended reality, will be accessible online for global viewers.

Moving on to a miraculous rescue story, in George, a building collapse trapped 33-year-old tiler Gabriel Guambe under rubble for a staggering 118 hours. Thanks to the sharp senses of a search and rescue dog named Abby, and her handler Sergeant Willie Visser, Guambe was discovered alive, sustaining only minor injuries. This event not only highlights the critical role of K9 units in rescue operations but also the emotional impact on the teams involved. As the recovery efforts continue, the incident has unfortunately seen a death toll rise to 19.

Over in the world of adventure, Mount Everest has witnessed record-breaking climbs. Nepali guide Kami Rita Sherpa reached the summit for the twenty-ninth time, setting a new world record, while British climber Kenton Cool marked his eighteenth ascent, the most by a foreign climber. With the climbing season just starting, Everest continues to attract and challenge climbers globally.

In South Africa, a startup led by Lisa von Benecke is gearing up to launch solar panel window blinds, a novel solution to energy issues caused by load-shedding. These blinds, which integrate solar panels within each slat, are designed to power devices like smartphones and laptops, and are expected to hit the market by the end of the year.

Turning to the entertainment sector, M-Net is launching a documentary series titled "School Ties," which delves into the serious issues of grooming and sexual abuse in prestigious South African boys' schools. The series aims to shed light on these harrowing stories while offering hope and strategies for prevention.

Lastly, in a thrilling development in drone technology, Mike and Luke Bell have set a new Guinness World Record for the fastest ground speed by a battery-powered drone, reaching 480.23 kilometers per hour. Their drone, named Peregreen, represents a significant advancement in drone speeds, potentially influencing future drone designs.

And in box office news, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” has made a remarkable debut, earning fifty-six point five million dollars in its opening weekend, marking it as one of the top openings of the year.
