### Transcript

Hello, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast. I'm Erika, and today is May 19th, 2024. We have a selection of intriguing news stories to discuss, so let's dive right in.

First up, President Cyril Ramaphosa recently shared his reflections on the ongoing 2024 elections, comparing the enthusiasm and turnout to South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994. Speaking from KwaZulu-Natal, he noted the significant voter queues abroad, which sparked his nostalgia. Ramaphosa also emphasized the importance of high voter turnout in strengthening the seventh administration and highlighted the ANC's focus on addressing issues like load shedding, corruption, and water crises. He also took this opportunity to remind smaller parties not to underestimate the ANC's influence and strength.

Moving on to sports, in a thrilling boxing match, Oleksandr Usyk defeated Tyson Fury by a split decision to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion in twenty-five years. The match, which lasted twelve rounds, saw Usyk maintain a relentless pace, particularly in the ninth round where he nearly knocked Fury out. Despite Fury's size and power, Usyk's sustained aggression and precision ultimately won him the title. The judges scored the fight 115-112 and 114-113 in Usyk's favor, with one judge scoring 114-113 for Fury. A rematch is anticipated later this year due to a contractual clause.

In rugby news, the DHL Stormers claimed a crucial 16-12 victory over Connacht in their penultimate league match in Galway. This win was vital for their chances in the Vodacom United Rugby Championship playoffs and Investec Champions Cup qualification. The victory was largely attributed to their strong scrum and the composure of flyhalf Manie Libbok, who was flawless with his kicks despite challenging windy conditions. This win places the Stormers in a strong position needing just a bonus point in their final game to secure a top-seven finish.

In a more somber story, professional golfer Scottie Scheffler was arrested amidst a chaotic situation outside Valhalla Golf Club, where a tournament worker was tragically struck and killed by a bus. This incident caused significant traffic disruptions, and Scheffler was arrested due to a misunderstanding while trying to navigate the restricted areas. He was later released and returned to the course in time for his tee, shooting 5-under par and positioning himself just three strokes behind the leader.

Turning to consumer trends, online shopping in South Africa has seen significant growth, with airtime vouchers being the most popular purchase, followed by clothing and groceries. The online retail sector grew by thirty percent over the past year, now accounting for six point one five percent of all retail. This growth is expected to continue, with projections suggesting that eCommerce could account for over ten percent of all retail sales by the end of 2025.

Lastly, AMC Networks has decided to add a trigger warning to the classic mob movie "Goodfellas," citing language and cultural stereotypes that may offend some viewers. This decision has sparked various reactions, particularly from individuals associated with the film, who argue that such warnings might undermine the film's historical authenticity.

That's all for today's discussion on the 'Just a Moment News' podcast. I'm Erika, and we hope you found these discussions insightful. Join us again next time for more news updates. Thank you for tuning in, and have a wonderful day!
