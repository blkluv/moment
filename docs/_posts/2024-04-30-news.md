### Transcript

Hello, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I’m Erika, and today is April 30, 2024. We’ve got a variety of stories to discuss, so let’s dive right in.

First up, we have some sad news from the sports world. Dingaan "Rose of Soweto" Thobela, a former boxing world champion from South Africa, has passed away at the age of 57. Thobela, who had been battling illness, was found deceased in his Johannesburg flat. Throughout his career, he secured three world titles in two weight divisions, including the prestigious WBC super middleweight belt. Thobela was a celebrated figure in South Africa, particularly known for his victories that sparked significant celebrations in townships. His death marks a somber period for the boxing community in the region, especially following the recent loss of another notable South African boxer, Joseph Makaringe.

Switching gears to the business sector, let’s talk about a remarkable achievement by a South African startup, uAfrica. Originally a price comparison site called Jump Shopping, founded by Jaco Roux in 2004, it transformed into a significant e-commerce logistics entity. This shift was catalyzed by a strategic pivot and an exclusive reseller agreement with Shopify. The partnership, which began in 2014, was crucial in scaling uAfrica’s operations across Africa. Despite Shopify discontinuing its reseller program, uAfrica maintains a strong relationship with the platform, continuing its success with apps in the Shopify app store.

In the realm of technology and innovation, scientists have developed a method to create lab-grown diamonds in just 150 minutes. This process, which involves rapidly heating and cooling a mix of liquid metals at atmospheric pressure, offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional diamond mining. This innovation is reshaping the diamond industry, as the growing popularity of lab-created diamonds is driving down prices and challenging traditional industry paradigms.

Moving on to corporate news, WeWork has made headlines with its bankruptcy proceedings. The company has reached an agreement with its junior creditors and received additional funding from senior lenders, rejecting a $650 million bid from co-founder Adam Neumann. This plan aims to erase its $4 billion in debt and transfer the company's equity primarily to these senior lenders. The restructuring plan is set to move forward, with hopes to exit bankruptcy by the end of May.

In entertainment, Richard Gadd, a once struggling stand-up comic, turned a traumatic real-life experience with a stalker into a hit Netflix series called "Baby Reindeer." The series, which Gadd wrote, directed, and starred in, has reached the top of the Netflix charts in thirty countries. However, it has also stirred controversy, as online detectives quickly identified Gadd's anonymized stalker, leading to severe online harassment and legal threats. This situation highlights the complex dynamics of privacy, identity, and the repercussions of fame.

Lastly, in tourism news, the Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko is taking measures to discourage disruptive tourism by obstructing the view of Mount Fuji from a popular site. This action is part of broader efforts to manage the influx of tourists and reduce the impact on local environments and communities, including introducing a fee for those climbing Mount Fuji via its most popular route.

That wraps up our news for today. Thank you for tuning into Just a Moment News. I’m Erika, and I hope you found our discussions insightful. Have a great day, and we’ll see you next time!
