### Transcript

Good day, I'm Erika from Just a Moment News, and here are the headlines for today, October 27, 2023.

First up, we have a chilling documentary series called "Boetie Boer: Inside the Mind of a Monster." Directed by Jasyn Howes, the series explores the life and crimes of notorious serial killer Stewart Wilken. Wilken's killing spree, which began in 1990, included the murder of at least seven individuals, including young boys, sex workers, and even his own daughter. The series uses interviews and dramatizations to delve into Wilken's acts and examine the societal impact on affected communities. Interestingly, Howes had the opportunity to meet Wilken during the research phase of the series, and his initial preconceptions about the killer were significantly altered after their meetings. Howes hopes that the series will spark discussions about society's role in shaping the "monsters of the future" and shed light on the inadequate investigation of the original crimes due to the victims' disenfranchised backgrounds.

Next, we have news about Taylor Swift, who has reached billionaire status. According to Bloomberg, Swift's net worth is now $1.1 billion, primarily driven by her record-breaking "Eras" tour. Swift's impact goes beyond music, as she is described as an "economic phenomenon" that boosts local economies and influences ticket prices, even in the NFL. Her tour is predicted to become the highest-grossing ever, with potential ticket sales of $2.2 billion in North America. Swift's cultural and economic influence is comparable to other entertainment industry billionaires like Rihanna, Jay Z, and Beyonc√©. She continues to expand her reach by re-recording her early albums, further solidifying her status as a powerhouse in the industry.

Moving on, Tesla has made its first significant Supercharger deal with BP. BP will acquire $100 million worth of Supercharger hardware from Tesla, marking the first time a company has procured Tesla's DC fast-charging equipment for a third-party charging network. This purchase supports BP Pulse's ambitious plan to establish a nationwide charging network in the UK by 2030, with an investment of up to $1 billion. Tesla's chargers can operate at a maximum of 250kW and cater to most electric vehicles. BP Pulse aims to set up these chargers at various BP-associated businesses and third-party sites, starting with cities like Houston, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, DC. The deal signifies a significant step in expanding the accessibility of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

In retail news, the Bureau of Market Research (BMR) forecasts a substantial Black Friday period in South Africa this year. Despite economic challenges such as load shedding, decreased consumer spending, and increased inflation, the BMR expects Black Friday to contribute an additional 26.6 billion Rand to the retail sector. General dealers are expected to benefit the most, while sectors like food and medical goods may not see significant gains. The report also highlights the growing significance of online retail during this period, suggesting that retailers with a robust online presence are likely to see higher sales volumes. The expansion of Black Friday from a single day to a month-long event offers retailers distinct opportunities to maximize revenue.

In the world of combat sports, there's an upcoming boxing match between heavyweight champion Tyson Fury and former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou. This crossover between MMA and boxing has become a trend in recent years, with fighters like Conor McGregor surprising audiences with their performance in the boxing ring. Fury is known for his technical skill and strategy, while Ngannou is famous for his raw power. Pre-fight appearances suggest that Fury may not be in optimal shape, while Ngannou is rigorously training under the guidance of Mike Tyson. To stand a chance against Fury, Ngannou will need to effectively dodge Fury's longer reach and focus on body blows. This fight adds to the growing list of crossover and exhibition bouts, offering an unpredictable but potentially lucrative spectacle in combat sports.

Lastly, we have a peculiar situation in Porirua, New Zealand, where residents are dealing with late-night "siren battles" involving cars and bikes with large speakers blaring Celine Dion songs. This phenomenon, which has been happening for seven years in parts of New Zealand, has intensified since November 2022. Local authorities are aware of the issue, and residents have initiated a petition to stop this disruptive activity. Mayor Anita Baker plans to consult with the police to find a resolution to this unusual disturbance.

That's all for today's news. Join us again tomorrow for more updates. I'm Erika from Just a Moment News. Have a great day!

[Closing greeting]
