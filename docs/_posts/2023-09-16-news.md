### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is September 16, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have a story from South Africa. President Cyril Ramaphosa's special adviser, Olive Shisana, has proposed an annual spending of up to 88.5 billion rand on poverty alleviation measures. However, the National Treasury, led by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, warns of depleting funds and the need for spending cuts. This clash between fiscal caution and social responsibility reveals internal discord within the administration and poses electoral risks for the ruling ANC party. The ANC now faces the challenging decision between austerity for economic growth or increased social spending to secure voter support. It's a tough path ahead for them.

Moving on to sports, New Zealand's rugby team, the All Blacks, regained their footing in the Rugby World Cup with a dominant 71-3 win over Namibia. The All Blacks' offense was on fire, scoring six tries in the first half and another five in the second. Standouts Cam Roigard and Damian McKenzie showcased New Zealand's depth and talent. While this win provided a morale boost for the team, there are lingering concerns about their discipline, specifically a high penalty count. Head coach Ian Foster needs to address this vulnerability as they prepare for their upcoming match against Italy. On the other hand, the massive skill disparity between New Zealand and Namibia was evident, highlighting the ongoing challenge for lesser-known teams like Namibia to catch up with Tier One teams.

In the entertainment world, Netflix's live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga series One Piece has become a global hit. The show has broken the "live-action curse" and received critical acclaim, with an 85% approval rating from critics and a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Filmed in South Africa, the show has also had a significant economic impact on the local film industry, creating jobs and investing millions of dollars. Netflix plans to continue this cross-cultural collaboration in its second season, and the success of One Piece could pave the way for future global projects by the streaming giant.

Shifting our focus to cricket, South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen delivered an exceptional performance against Australia, dominating the match. Despite facing the No.1 ranked ODI bowler Josh Hazlewood, Klaasen's aggressive batting yielded multiple sixes. His improved form, supported by Proteas coaches, contributed to a series-tying 164-run victory for South Africa. Alongside Rassie van der Dussen and David Miller, Klaasen accelerated the run rate, pushing the team's total to 416/5. It was a great day for South Africa, with Lungi Ngidi also taking four wickets.

In other news, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has frozen bank accounts linked to a KZN-based company, 05 ZZET Enterprises (Pty) Ltd. The company, connected to NLC official Sibonelo Vilakazi and his wife Nosipho Zanele Zuma, had received over R32 million from non-profits granted Lottery funds. The investigation was initiated after suspicious transactions were flagged by the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC). The SIU has secured a preservation order against the company, freezing about 2.4 million Rand. The remaining 30 million Rand and the nature of ZZET's business activities are still unclear.

Lastly, Sotheby's New York is set to auction Pablo Picasso's painting "Femme à la Montre" ("Woman in Watch") in November. Experts estimate it could sell for over $120 million, potentially becoming the second most expensive Picasso work ever auctioned. The painting, based on Picasso's mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter, has a controversial backstory as it reportedly led to the end of his marriage to Olga Khokhlova. Sotheby's has a history of auctioning Picasso works, but none have surpassed the record $179.37 million paid for "Women of Algiers" at a Christie's auction in 2015.

That's all for today's news. I hope you found these stories interesting. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and I'll be back with more news tomorrow. Have a great day!
