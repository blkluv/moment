### Transcript

Hello and welcome to 'Just a Moment News'. I'm your host, Erika, and today is January 14, 2024. Let's dive into today's stories.

First up, we have a rather tragic situation unfolding in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where recent floods have taken the lives of 43 people. The districts of Harry Gwala, Umgungundlovu, and Umzinyathi have been hit the hardest. Among the fatalities was a man in Umzinyathi whose vehicle was swept away by the raging waters. With more rain forecasted, disaster teams are on high alert, and the community is urged to exercise caution.

Switching gears to sports, the DHL Stormers have secured a bonus-point victory over the Sale Sharks in the third round of the Champions Cup. Standout player Hacjivah Dayimani scored the first try and showed exceptional skill in both attack and defence. Despite some defensive lapses, the Stormers maintained control and came out on top. They're now gearing up to face Stade Fran√ßais in Paris for their final group-stage game.

In rugby news, former Australia coach Eddie Jones has taken up the challenge of coaching Japan's rugby team. Despite admitting to some self-doubt and acknowledging his past failures, Jones remains confident in his decisions and coaching approach. His first match with Japan will be against England, adding a personal dimension to the competition.

In the world of aviation, NASA has unveiled its X-59 aircraft, a supersonic plane designed to fly at 925 mph at 55,000 feet, while minimizing sonic booms to a "barely-audible" thump. The aim is to potentially halve flight times across the U.S. or elsewhere, although the economic viability of this remains in question.

The tech sector has started the year with significant job cuts, coinciding with increased investments in artificial intelligence. Over 5,500 tech layoffs were reported in the first two weeks of 2024, affecting various roles in both major companies and startups. As the tech industry layoffs continue, they're attracting attention from labor advocates and lawmakers.

In legal news, film studios are making a third attempt to force Reddit to reveal user information in relation to copyright infringement cases. The studios demand Reddit to provide IP address logs of users discussing piracy, which Reddit has refused, citing First Amendment rights.

Lastly, a Norwegian company, Heimdall Power, is introducing "magic balls" to monitor high-voltage power lines in the United States. These sphere-shaped sensors, which can be installed quickly by drones, increase power-line capacity by 30% and could potentially improve U.S. grid stability.

That's all for today's news. I'm Erika, and this has been 'Just a Moment News'. Tune in tomorrow for more updates. Stay informed and have a wonderful day!
