### Transcript

Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is October 28, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have a story about Lionel Messi, the renowned soccer player who recently signed with Inter Miami Football Club. This move has had a significant impact on ticket sales and fan engagement. Apple TV+ is broadcasting Major League Soccer (MLS) games and has a documentary series called "Messi Meets America" that focuses on Messi's professional and personal life. The series, produced by Smuggler Entertainment and showrunner Scott Boggins, aims to make soccer accessible to both casual and die-hard fans by providing an in-depth look at Messi's journey in real-time.

Next, we have news from X, formerly known as Twitter. They have introduced two new subscription plans: Premium Plus and Basic. Premium Plus offers the largest boost in replies, an ad-free experience, and additional perks like tweet editing and encrypted DMs for $16/month. The Basic plan, priced at $3/month, provides a smaller reply boost without ad reduction or verification. These new plans are part of Elon Musk's strategy to monetize the platform and offer users more features.

Moving on, researchers from the University of Pretoria and the Mammalian Methylation Consortium have made significant progress in understanding the ageing process in mammals, including humans. By analyzing thousands of samples from various species, they discovered that both the genome and epigenome play a role in biological traits such as lifespan and susceptibility to diseases. Their findings challenge the previous belief that ageing was solely due to random cellular damage and suggest that epigenetic factors follow a predetermined "programme." This research has wide-ranging implications, from predicting and treating age-related diseases to aiding conservation efforts and forensic science.

In sports news, MultiChoice South Africa is offering a special rate of 19.95 Rand for its DStv Stream Access package, allowing subscribers to watch the Rugby World Cup final between the Springboks and the All Blacks. This offer is an alternative to DStv Premium and free broadcasts from SABC. The CEO of MultiChoice, Marc Jury, aims to include as many viewers as possible for this significant sporting event. Subscribers can only stream to one device at a time, and the pricing at 19.95 Rand is a nod to the historic 1995 Rugby World Cup.

Moving on, Fezakele Kolisi, the father of Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, believes that his son's talent in rugby has not only led him to a historic role but also united their previously fractured family. Despite past hardships, Siya ensured his father was present during crucial matches, and they now communicate regularly. Fezakele is optimistic about the Springboks winning the Rugby World Cup, specifically the upcoming final against New Zealand.

Lastly, we have a cricket story. Keshav Maharaj, a South African player who made an unlikely comeback after a ruptured Achilles tendon, played a crucial role in South Africa's World Cup campaign. In a tense match against Pakistan, Maharaj ended up scoring the winning runs alongside No.11 batsman Tabraiz Shamsi, leading to a one-wicket triumph for South Africa. This game showcased the depth of South Africa's bowling attack, with Gerald Coetzee emerging as a formidable force. Maharaj expressed his belief in the team's quality and depth, emphasizing the significant contributions from unexpected quarters.

That's all for today's news. Stay informed, and have a great day. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
