Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 29, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have the news of the passing of Charles Munger, a key figure in the transformation of Berkshire Hathaway alongside Warren Buffett. Munger, a lawyer by training, played a significant role in shaping Buffett's long-term investment philosophy. He was known for his straight talk and criticism of corporate excesses. Munger's partnership with Buffett spanned over six decades, and together, they made collaborative investments in pivotal companies. Munger's death marks the end of an era in Berkshire Hathaway's history. 

Moving on, the South African Post Office has been forcefully evicted from its branch in the Boulders Shopping Centre in Midrand, causing disruptions in service delivery and access to locked parcels. This eviction highlights the financial struggles of the South African Post Office, with multiple branches in arrears. Business Rescue Practitioners are working to redirect parcels from the affected branch. The broader financial issues of the South African Post Office include proposed layoffs and branch closures. The situation has had a visible impact on citizens, particularly those unable to access services like pension payments at the Midrand branch.

Next, we have news about Cotton On, an Australian retailer, and its expansion plans in South Africa. Despite facing challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and a stagnant economy, Cotton On had initially planned to open over 300 stores in South Africa by 2023. However, the expansion slowed down, and they currently have fewer than 200 stores in the country. Nevertheless, South Africa remains their third-largest market globally. The company's financial report for 2023 showed a decline in African revenue, mainly from South Africa. Cotton On's revenue primarily comes from retail sales, with a smaller portion from wholesale sources.

In the world of sports, Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is selling a majority stake in the team to Miriam Adelson, wife of the late Sheldon Adelson. The sale is valued at $3.5 billion, and Cuban will retain a minority stake and continue overseeing basketball operations. This news comes alongside Cuban's announcement of leaving the TV show "Shark Tank" after 16 seasons. There is also speculation about a potential partnership between Cuban and Adelson in a Dallas casino and arena venture.

Moving on to entertainment, South African comedian Trevor Noah's Off The Record tour has been a resounding success. Noah recently had three gigs at London's O2 arena, where 50 thousand people attended his shows. The O2 arena, with a capacity of 20 thousand people, is the second-largest indoor arena in the UK. Noah expressed his gratitude for the overwhelming support and shared his experience of performing in front of such a large audience.

In the world of finance, Major League Baseball (MLB), Formula 1, and Mercedes-Benz's Formula 1 team are facing fraud suits for promoting the FTX cryptocurrency. FTX investors are suing these entities, alleging an $11 billion fraud and accusing them of aiding FTX's alleged fraudulent activities. The lawsuit includes over two dozen celebrities who endorsed FTX, such as Tom Brady and Steph Curry. MLB and Mercedes Formula 1 have ended their promotional deals with FTX following its financial collapse.

Lastly, we have news about Tesla's Cybertruck. Elon Musk has expressed concerns about the manufacturing challenges posed by the vehicle's stainless steel body and its reliance on Tesla's in-house battery cells, which are behind schedule. Despite the challenges, Musk is determined to produce the Cybertruck and anticipates intense effort for the next 12 to 18 months to achieve high-volume production. Some suggest canceling the Cybertruck to benefit Tesla's shares, but Musk remains committed to bringing the innovative vehicle to market.

And that's all for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. I'm Erika, and this is Just a Moment News. Have a great day!
