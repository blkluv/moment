Good morning and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is September 13, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, Apple has unveiled its latest lineup of products set to release on September 22. The iPhone 15 series introduces several significant changes, including a customizable "action button" on Pro models, USB-C ports to replace Lightning ports, and a 48MP main camera across all models. The Pro models also come with an A17 chip suitable for high-end mobile gaming. Apple Watches also received upgrades with the new S9 chip, featuring a "double tap" gesture and improved dictation. In the audio category, Apple launched the second-generation AirPods Pro with improved sound quality and double the active noise cancellation capabilities. These releases are part of Apple's broader effort to dominate the technology market while adhering to sustainability initiatives.

Moving on, former Miss South Africa, Cindy Nell-Roberts, was among six people injured in a multi-vehicle crash involving an out-of-control truck on Kloof Nek Road in Cape Town. The accident is under investigation for reckless and negligent driving. Nell-Roberts described herself as "traumatized but fine," and road closures were in effect as emergency services cleared the wreckage.

In other news, Edwin Castro, the winner of Powerball's record $2 billion jackpot earlier this year, has purchased a $47 million Bel Air mansion with seven bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. This latest acquisition increases his total real estate spending to $76 million. Castro has also indulged in other luxuries like a $250,000 vintage Porsche.

Next, the North Gauteng High Court has mandated the City of Tshwane to disclose documents regarding its decision to award a R585 million IT contract to startup Brilliant Telecommunications. The contract, originally held by Altron for 18 years, involves critical services like Wi-Fi, telephony, emergency services, and power backups. Altron contends that Brilliant lacks the qualifications and resources for the role, and the court has ordered the city to release all pertinent documents. The ruling may pave the way for Altron to have the contract declared invalid.

Turning to weather news, recent high temperatures in parts of South Africa are attributed to a cold front pushing hot air inland. The South African Weather Service notes that while the temperatures are high, they haven't broken any records and are considered normal for this time of the year. The upcoming summer season is expected to be warmer due to the El Ni√±o phenomenon, and varying rainfall patterns are forecasted across the country. The weather is expected to cool down soon as a cold front moves east, bringing snow to some areas. High fire danger conditions are also forecasted for specific regions.

In the gaming world, Unity, a leading game development engine, has announced a new fee structure that has sparked significant backlash. The new "Unity Runtime Fee" will charge game developers on a per-install basis, ranging from $0.01 to $0.20. Many developers, especially in the indie community, have expressed concerns that this new model could be financially devastating. Some developers are now exploring alternative engines like Unreal and open-source engine Godot.

Lastly, MultiChoice's recently launched DStv Stream has faced complaints from users, citing issues ranging from annoying ads during CatchUp to missing channels and general functionality glitches. The company attributes some of these problems to the WACS undersea cable break and has implemented updates to resolve the issues. Subscribers continue to complain, particularly about the increase in ads on premium subscriptions. MultiChoice advises dissatisfied customers to report any issues and assures them that their technical teams are working to address the problems.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay informed, and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News.
