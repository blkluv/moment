### Transcript

Good day, everyone! This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', and today is April 14, 2024. We've got a lot to discuss, so let's jump right in.

In a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East, Iran has launched a direct attack on Israel from its own territory, firing over 300 cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as drones. This is an unprecedented move, and it seems to be a response to a recent attack on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria. Israel, along with American and allied forces, managed to intercept most of the incoming threats, reducing the impact on Israeli soil. However, some missiles and drones did cause light damage, including a serious injury to a child. In the aftermath, Israeli airspace has been reopened, indicating a temporary reduction in the threat level. President Biden has condemned Iran's actions and reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel.

In sports news, Alex Pereira has defended his UFC light heavyweight championship at UFC 300, knocking out Jamahal Hill in the first round. Pereira quickly recovered from a low blow and executed a powerful left hook that ended the fight. He expressed satisfaction with his performance and indicated a desire to return quickly to the octagon at UFC 301 in Brazil, suggesting a potential move up to fight at heavyweight.

In golf, Scottie Scheffler, the world's No 1 ranked player, has taken the lead in the third round of the Masters. Despite a bogey at the fourth, Scheffler birdied two of the first three holes to maintain a narrow lead. Tiger Woods, on the other hand, experienced the worst nine holes of his Masters career, hampering his chase for a sixth green jacket. Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm also faced challenges, ending the third round well back from the leaders.

In football, Wrexham has secured a dominant 6-0 victory over Forest Green Rovers, clinching promotion to League One. This promotion marks Wrexham's second consecutive leap upwards and their return to the English Football League after a 15-year absence. The team's journey, since being acquired by celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, has been captured in the FX series "Welcome to Wrexham." Meanwhile, Stockport County also secured promotion to League One.

Manchester City's manager Pep Guardiola made headlines not for his team's performance in the Champions League quarter-finals, but for the Richard Mille watch he was spotted wearing. Valued at $1.26 million, the watch is a limited edition, known for being the lightest mechanical watch ever created. Guardiola's interest in fashion started early in his football career, and his latest accessory choice underscores his penchant for luxury and high-end, innovative products.

Finally, the use of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT in academia has raised significant concerns. There's a growing issue of AI-assisted cheating, leading to widespread expulsions and diminished course enrollments. The implications of underqualified graduates entering critical sectors are alarming. However, the actual impact of AI on cheating rates is debated, with some research suggesting that cheating rates have not significantly increased with the introduction of AI. Some educators are integrating AI tools responsibly into the curriculum and increasing in-person assessments to curb dishonest practices.

And that's all for today's news. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' saying thank you for tuning in. Stay informed, stay safe, and see you next time.
