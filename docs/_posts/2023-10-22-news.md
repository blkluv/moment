Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is October 22, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

In a thrilling Rugby World Cup 2023 semifinal, South Africa managed to defeat England 16-15. Despite England's dominance in most of the match and leading 12-6 at halftime, South Africa's bench replacements, known as the "bomb squad," revitalized the team. The Springboks took advantage of four crucial scrum penalties in the final quarter, which gave them the opportunities to score and eventually secure the victory. Handre Pollard's 78th-minute penalty sealed the deal. This match showcased South Africa's mental resilience and ability to adapt, reflecting their head coach Jacques Nienaber's successful strategy. South Africa will now face the All Blacks in the final, while England will play against Argentina for the bronze medal. 

Moving on to the world of UFC, Islam Makhachev solidified his status as the world's best pound-for-pound fighter after defeating Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 294. Although Volkanovski accepted the fight on short notice, Makhachev's performance was compelling, especially considering he was originally set to fight Charles Oliveira, a completely different type of opponent. This victory puts Makhachev at a 2-0 record against Volkanovski and adds to his growing list of accolades, tying Khabib Nurmagomedov's 13-fight UFC winning streak. Makhachev's achievement has even overshadowed Jon Jones' remarkable career, at least for the moment.

In cricket news, Heinrich Klaasen delivered an outstanding century for South Africa in a crucial ODI World Cup match against defending champions England. Despite battling exhaustion and heat, Klaasen managed to turn the game into a "cauldron," absorbing and transferring the pressure. His partnership with Reeza Hendricks and Rassie van der Dussen provided a solid foundation for South Africa, overcoming an early wicket loss. Klaasen's batting, coupled with his resilience to keep running despite physical strain, made it a memorable innings. This performance was particularly significant given his past struggles with health and emotional well-being. South Africa's bowlers finished what Klaasen started, confirming the team's prowess under pressure. The match took place in a near-full Wankhede Stadium with an intense atmosphere, as both English and South African fans passionately supported their teams.

In sad news, Bobby Charlton, iconic England World Cup winner and Manchester United legend, passed away at the age of 86. Charlton played a key role in England's 1966 World Cup victory and also contributed significantly to Manchester United's European Cup win in 1968. His career was even more remarkable considering that he survived the tragic 1958 Munich air crash that claimed the lives of eight of his teammates. Charlton's impact on football was monumental, holding long-standing records at Manchester United and earning 106 caps for England. He was knighted in 1994 for his contributions to the sport. Our thoughts go out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time.

Shifting gears, renowned comedian and host of The Daily Show, Trevor Noah, is set to debut a new podcast on Spotify called What Now? With Trevor Noah on November 9th. This podcast aims to offer a more informal and in-depth extension of the conversations Noah is known for on television. Each episode will feature discussions with a diverse set of influential figures, including entertainment personalities, CEOs, and athletes. The show is described as featuring "radical candor" and "authentic back-and-forths." Co-executive produced by Ben Winston, known for his work on The Late Late Show with James Corden and the Grammys, the podcast promises to address a wide range of issues. We're excited to see what Trevor Noah has in store for us with this new venture.

Lastly, Fisher Stevens, the director and producer of the Netflix docuseries on soccer icon David Beckham, shares his insights and challenges faced while creating the show. Despite Beckham's reputation for being private, Stevens was able to capture candid reflections on his career and personal life. The series provides an in-depth look at Beckham, including moments like a candid interaction with his wife Victoria and archival footage. While some key issues, such as Beckham's relationship with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and controversies surrounding him, were touched upon, not all were included for various reasons. Stevens also discusses the unique filmmaking techniques used, his other works, and the ongoing actors' strike. The series has been well-received and is currently among Netflix's global Top 10.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay informed and have a great day, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
