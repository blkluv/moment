Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is August 29, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, WordPress is making waves in the online world by offering a 100-year domain registration for a one-time fee of $38,000. This package includes automatic backup, advanced ownership tools, and 24/7 support. The goal behind this move is to preserve family history or business milestones for the long term. However, there are some uncertainties surrounding this plan, such as how WordPress will adapt to internet changes or what will happen if they discontinue the service. With the ever-evolving tech landscape, the longevity of this 100-year plan remains uncertain.

Next, Uber Eats is reportedly developing an AI chatbot that will offer recommendations and speed up the ordering process. Hidden code discovered by developer Steve Moser suggests that the chatbot will take into account users' budgets and food preferences. This aligns with Uber's use of AI for customer-driver matching and follows similar advancements by competitors like DoorDash and Instacart. It seems that the industry as a whole is leveraging AI to enhance the user experience.

Moving on, Amazon's highly anticipated e-commerce launch in South Africa is still pending. Originally scheduled for February, the delay raises questions about its impact on existing players like Massmart and Takealot. Despite challenges in the South African retail sector, analysts believe that Amazon's entrance could be disruptive due to its advanced automation and logistics capabilities. Takealot, in anticipation of Amazon's arrival, is focusing on faster delivery options. While Amazon will need to navigate local compliance and competition, its potential for scale could significantly disrupt the local retail landscape.

In the chess world, Chess.com and Hans Niemann have settled a contentious lawsuit involving a cheating scandal. Niemann has dropped his $100 million lawsuit against Chess.com and Magnus Carlsen, allowing him to return to competitive play. The absence of conclusive evidence regarding Niemann's alleged cheating led to this resolution. The specific details surrounding the allegations at the Sinquefield Cup remain undisclosed. Both parties expressed satisfaction with the settlement, and Niemann looks forward to future competition.

In a surprising land purchase, Flannery Associates, led by notable figures from Silicon Valley, has spent over $800 million to acquire undeveloped land near Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, California. The group, including Reid Hoffman, Laurene Powell Jobs, and Marc Andreessen, plans to transform the land into a sustainable, pedestrian-friendly city. However, concerns regarding national security were initially raised, suspecting foreign involvement. The company has clarified that 97% of the investment is American, but the project still faces zoning and regulatory hurdles.

Lastly, public outrage continues to escalate in Madrid over a non-consensual kiss by Luis Rubiales, the president of the Spanish Football Federation, towards Spain attacker Jenni Hermoso during the Women's World Cup final medal ceremony. Organized by the feminist group Comision8M, hundreds marched demanding Rubiales' resignation and condemning institutional sexism. FIFA has suspended Rubiales for 90 days, and there are calls for suspension from Spain's Sports Tribunal as well. This incident has caused turmoil within the Spanish women's national team, with coaches resigning and players boycotting. It has sparked discussions on eradicating systemic sexism in sports and public institutions.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay informed, and we'll catch you next time. I'm Erika, and this is Just a Moment News.
