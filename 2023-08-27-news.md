### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is August 27th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have a story from South Africa. Eskom, the country's power utility, is under investigation for a controversial R500 million security contract awarded to Fidelity Services Group. Eskom is now targeting whistleblowers who leaked information about the deal, sparking criticism that they are trying to shift the focus away from the executives involved. In a surprising twist, documents have surfaced showing that Eskom bypassed its own payment policy to fast-track payments to Fidelity. This suggests that the same executives implicated in the original contract may have orchestrated efforts to hide the deal's details and prioritize payments. This situation is raising concerns about transparency and accountability within Eskom.

Moving on to Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been declared the winner of the country's presidential election. He secured 52% of the vote and 2.3 million votes overall, according to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. However, international observers have criticized the election, and the main opposition party, Citizens Coalition for Change, led by Nelson Chamisa, alleges manipulation of the results. The CCC plans to contest the outcome, and the political climate in Harare remains tense.

Christopher Nolan's World War II biopic, "Oppenheimer," secured the fourth spot, and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem" rounded out the top five.

In other news, health authorities in California have issued a warning following a Tough Mudder race at Sonoma Raceway. Nearly two dozen participants developed symptoms such as rashes, fever, muscle pain, and nausea. The Sonoma County Department of Health Services suspects that the participants contracted the bacteria Aeromonas through open wounds during the event's obstacle courses involving mud and water. It's important for those experiencing symptoms to consult a physician for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Lastly, in the world of sports, ex-featherweight champion Max Holloway delivered a vicious knockout to "The Korean Zombie" Chan Sung Jung in the UFC Singapore main event. The match was fast-paced and saw both fighters taking significant risks. Holloway's devastating right hand ended the fight just 23 seconds into the third round.
