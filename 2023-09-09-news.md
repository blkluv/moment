Good day, listeners! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for September 9, 2023. Let's dive right in.

First up, we have the sad news of the passing of Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the age of 95. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the death of Buthelezi, who held several important positions throughout his life, including being the Prince of KwaPhindangene and the Traditional Prime Minister to the Zulu Monarch. Buthelezi was also the Founder and President Emeritus of the Inkatha Freedom Party. President Ramaphosa acknowledged Buthelezi's significant contributions to South Africa's political and cultural landscape, as well as his role in the country's liberation and democratic transitions. Funeral arrangements and further reflections on his life will be made in due course.

Moving on, let's talk about the Rugby World Cup match between France and New Zealand. In a thrilling contest, France emerged victorious with a score of 27-13. This marked the first time the All Blacks, the three-times champions, were defeated in a World Cup pool match. Despite losing their captain Sam Cane to injury just before kickoff, New Zealand managed to open the scoring through winger Mark Telea. However, France fought back and secured the win with tries from Damian Penaud and Melvyn Jaminet, along with penalties from Thomas Ramos. It was a match of rare intensity, and France showcased their title aspirations with this impressive victory.

Next, we have news about upcoming drama series on DStv's M-Net. Four international co-productions, namely "Devil's Peak," "Spinners," "Reyka," and "White Lies," are set to air in the coming months. These English-language crime stories are all set in picturesque South African locations. During a MIP Africa session, MultiChoice executives highlighted the importance of understanding both local and international audiences to create authentic and relatable content. They also mentioned that while crime dramas perform well, there is a general lack of appetite for overt violence. Additionally, reality TV in South Africa thrives when it provides a sense of "tabloid voyeurism" or addresses meaningful, family-based issues.

Moving on to a more disturbing story, former YouTube "momfluencer" Ruby Franke is facing charges of aggravated child abuse. During a court hearing, Franke made allegations that one of her minor children had sexually abused family members and neighbors for years, although no evidence was provided. Franke was arrested after a malnourished child with duct tape on their limbs escaped from her home. She could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Franke's husband denies involvement, and YouTube has deleted her account. Signs of Franke's concerning behavior, such as extreme punishments for her children, have resurfaced online.

In the world of celebrities, model Nina Agdal, who is engaged to Logan Paul, is suing Dillon Danis, Paul's boxing opponent, for nonconsensual image-based sexual abuse, commonly known as "revenge porn." Agdal claims that Danis violated the 2022 Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization by sharing explicit images of her without consent. A forensics company confirmed that Agdal's private Snapchat was compromised. Following these actions, Danis's Twitter account was temporarily locked, and Misfits Boxing threatened to cancel the fight unless he deleted the posts. This case sheds light on the evolving landscape of online abuse and the legal measures now available to victims.

Lastly, the Recording Academy, responsible for the Grammys, has clarified that the AI-generated Drake song "Heart on My Sleeve" will not be eligible for an award. The song's vocals were not legally obtained or cleared by the label or the artists, and it is not commercially available. The Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr., emphasized the Academy's commitment to supporting and representing human artists and creators. The use of AI-generated vocals in music has raised questions and challenges for streaming platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.

And that wraps up today's news stories. Stay informed, stay curious, and stay tuned for more updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off. Have a great day!
